# Simply Beyond

Simply Beyond is a Peak Class 5 difficulty, located between Error.exe and Critical, and is one of the last humanly impossible difficulties before the physically impossible sector of the chart. At this point, obstacles start to become incoherent and usually involve strange techniques without a clear way of performing them. Making a TAS of Simply Beyond is infeasible. As a high-end humanly impossible difficulty, it approaches the border of physical possibility, Supreme.
