<span style="color:greenyellow">'''Calm'''</span> is a transitional difficulty between the Eternal Towers of Hell difficulties {{Class1Difficulties|Easy|25px}} [[w:c:jtoh:Easy|Easy]] and {{Class1Difficulties|Medium|25px}} [[w:c:jtoh:Medium|Medium]]. As this difficulty is on the lower spectrum of the EToH chart, obstacles here tend to be passable without much effort. Any contraptions (i.e conveyors and fading platforms) are usually indicated and often much slower to deal harm than normal client objects typically would. Additionally, killbricks are used rather infrequently, and 1-1.5 stud platforms are almost never used within towers of this difficulty. 
==Obstacles==
Keep in mind that due to the variance of obstacle difficulty, these generally should not be used as a basis for obstacles.

==Trivia== 
*'''Calm''' is the second difficulty made by Viranenthusiast.
*Since its creation, this difficulty has received nine revamps.
*There were many different variants of this difficulty made across the years.<ref>These should not be considered serious anymore; a majority of them are either lost media or not related to the difficulty anymore.</ref>
*There is no continuing on from this point or icon representation section(s) due to the redundancy of them.
