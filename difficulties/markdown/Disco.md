# Disco

Disco is a Class Negative, humanly possible difficulty that comes after Exist and before Relax. While some may call it "easy," Disco is so simple that players barely need to be presentâ€”it's a haven for those seeking a break from challenge. The difficulty is characterized by its lightheartedness and ease, making it a quick and pleasant experience for anyone who encounters it.
