Unlike the original, which is in [[:Category:Class 3|Low Rank 3]], this difficulty is the midpoint of [[:Category:Class 14|Class 9]], being in the mid spectrum of the class. However, it used to be in [[:Category:Class 15|Peripheral Class 15]]. 

It is currently a successor to [[File:OmniscientDiff.png|frameless|30x30px]] [[Omniscient]], and a predecessor to [[File:VHD.gif|frameless|29x29px]] [[User blog:EpicTheGamer2014/Peril|Vrery hawrfd rdifficutl!!]]. During its time in the End of the Official Chart, it was a predecessor of the difficulty-ized 52! phenomenon, known as [[File:52!.jpg|frameless|30x30px]] '''<u>[[User blog:EpicTheGamer2014/52!|52!]]</u>'''[[User blog:EpicTheGamer2014/52!|,]] and was a successor to [[File:Obama Prism Ultimate.png|frameless|36x36px]] [[User blog:EpicTheGamer2014/True Obama Prism|True Obama Prism]]. Also, during its time in Class 14 it was a successor to [[File:The MiddlelineNew.png|frameless|45x45px]] [[The Middleline]], and a predecessor to [[File:Peril.png|frameless|30x30px]] [[User blog:EpicTheGamer2014/Peril|Peril]].

The ludicrous sizes of these obstacles nullify all uses of boost items, even blessed coil. You will never be able to beat this difficulty, or create towers in this difficulty, due to how high up this difficulty is.

=== Icon Representation ===

====Current Icon====
<center>[[File:Unfathomable Icon.png|frameless|100x100px]]</center>
This icon has quite a bit of detail. This icon is [[File:NilIcon100.png|frameless|30x30px]] [[w:c:jtohs-hardest-towers:Nil|<span style="color:#696969">Nil</span>]]’s icon, but in the PoM {{Class3Difficulties|Horrific}} [[w:c:jtohs-hardest-towers:Horrific|<span style="color:#FFA8FF">Horrific</span>]] and Unreal icon style. In the middle, there is a confident/evil-like face, with the outline being white (up until this point, the icon has been made in IbisPaintX). Finally, there are some filters applied to it, some of them being jitter, slices and RGB Shift (these filters were applied in PhotoSmosh).
|-|
Old Icon=
====Old Icon====
<center>[[File:Unfathomable Icon Old.png|frameless|100x100px]]</center> 
This icon is basically the new icon, but with absolutely no filters. It was made in IbisPaintX., and is technically the JCC icon.
|-|
Older Icon=
====Older Icon====
<center>[[File:Unfathomable Icon Older.png|frameless|100x100px]]</center> 
This icon is Nil’s icon, but in the style of the new Horrific and Unreal icons, and with a confident face. However, the grey border is much bigger than what the actual PoM icons are, the mouth is smiling, and not evil-like, and the eyes and eyebrows are slightly iffy and off.

*This difficulty was originally made for  [[w:c:jtohs-custom-chart:Unfathomable|JToH’s Custom Chart]].
*This is the first difficulty to opt out for a template instead of headers.
*This difficulty used to be the first to use fanarts/artworks for sections, but they are not used anymore.
* This difficulty used to technically be a rebirth of [[File:NilIcon100.png|frameless|30x30px]] [[w:c:jtoh:nil|<span style="color:#696969">Nil</span>]], but then it eventually became a rebirth of nil.
