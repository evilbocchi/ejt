# Ifinitude

Ifinitude is a Class 0 sub-difficulty that serves as a remembrance of the old Ifinite chain from Class Negative. It lies between Vintage and Just Air, and is characterized by its extreme easeâ€”players do not need to do anything to complete it. The difficulty is more of a historical nod than a challenge, representing a piece of the chart's history that now only exists in the CDC. Completing Ifinitude is trivial, as it requires no effort or input from the player.
