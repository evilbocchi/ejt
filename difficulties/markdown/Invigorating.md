# Invigorating

Invigorating is a Class 5, humanly impossible difficulty that lies after Hellicious and before Apocalyptic. It is classified as "TAS impossible," meaning even Tool-Assisted Speedruns cannot complete it. The difficulty is known for its long, punishing obstacles that require extreme precision, timing, and luck.

Players are recommended to use special tools or exploits to even attempt this difficulty, as instakills and progress loss are common. The name "Invigorating" reflects the immense strength and energy required to face its challenges. Obstacles are often speedrun-related, and the icon is a simple black-to-red gradient, similar to Noxious.
