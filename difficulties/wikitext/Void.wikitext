<span style="color:black ;font-family:Georgia">'''Void'''</span> is a [[:Category:Difficulties|Devilish Difficulty]] incorporated in [[:Category:Class 7|Peak Class 7]], placed-inbetween [[File:Screen Shot 2020-08-10 at 9.50.46 AM.png|24px]] [[Infinity]] & its successor [[File:Screen Shot 2020-09-20 at 3.42.02 PM.png|24px]] [[Doog]]. This difficulty is [[:Category:Physically Impossible|physically-impossible]] or basically just <u>impossible</u> in simpler terms.

Obstacles of this difficulty are highly complex & janky. However, it is <u>completely pitch-black in your screen</u>, hence it's name <span style="color:black ;font-family:Georgia">'''Void'''</span>. Which means the difficulty requires inhuman and rough memorization aswell. It is speculated that it is [[:Category:TAS Impossible|TAS-Impossible]].
==Icon Representation==
The icon is represented with a dark void. For the alternate icon, it's the same but with some tiny depth added for it to make you truly feel alone. There's pretty much nothing else to explain, it is quite simplistic & bland. Let's not waste time.
==Obstacles==
The obstacles of this difficulty utilize janky-high complex jumps, glitches & many more. Topping that off with complete darkness, the difficulty has no chance of ever getting beaten soon even with assistances such as Tool Assistance Speedrun.
===Catches=== 
*Your screen will be completely pitch-black, but however. You can still move and press keys. Notice that you can still leave, so that you wont be stuck in the floor forever.
*Your chat-bubbles dont show up, neither does it show in the chatbox itself.
===Basics===
*130-147.8 stud jumps (Baseline-Peak)
*123.1-138.47 stud wraps (Baseline-Peak)
*60-87.6 stud stickouts (Baseline-Peak)
===Glitches===
*Truss-roof clip (Baseline)
*Instant-kb natural wallwalk lag abuse (Low)
* Low-fps fling (Middle)
*Fixed mid-air corner clip (High)
* CC false jump (Peak)
==Trivia==
*This difficulty was revamped by Rarezites.
==Continuing on from this point==
This difficulty could not bring you down? Your ambitions take over & you want to feel even more terror? Very well then, i present to you: [[File:Screen Shot 2020-09-20 at 3.42.02 PM.png|24px]] [[Doog]], it will be very-well harder than this. Goodluck.
