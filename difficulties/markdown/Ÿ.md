타 is a Class 6 sub-difficulty and the third difficulty of Mike's Difficulty Chart, out of 5. Preceding it is the second difficulty of the chain, D-E-L-T-A. After that lies Theta-Void, the penultimate difficulty of the chain. 타 is so difficult, it is impossible to complete naturally, even with a TAS. The only way to truly complete something of this nature is to abuse physics in ways that nobody has ever done, or use something like noclip or a coil.

타's name originates from the 타 found in Dutch and Afrikaans. This follows the pattern of different symbols being used in the difficulties in the chain, such as Delta being used in D-E-L-T-A and Theta-Void containing a theta (in its old icon).

This difficulty requires unimaginable luck and skill, even more than required in D-E-L-T-A, and incredible motivation to keep pushing through it. Though this difficulty does surpass D-E-L-T-A in difficulty and luck, there are still difficulties that require more to beat, such as Theta-Void.
