== What is the Error Chain? ==
The Error Chain is one of the oldest chains on this wiki, it includes errored things such as atoms, planets, universes and other stuff. It goes from [[File:AtomError.png|frameless|40px]] [[Atom Error]] to [[File:NewHyperversalError.jpg|40px]] [[Hyperversal Error]], ranging from class 7 to all the way to class 17, which is 10 classes apart for just 8 difficulties, spanning from physical impossibility to logically impossible category. It was formerly owned by [[User:YataDev|YataDev]], Now currently owned by [[User:Astrominal|Astrominal]]. 

=== History ===
in 2020 the Error Chain was originally made in [[Great Citadel of Custom, Impossible and Normal Difficulties]] place, containing only 9 difficulties in total. Later [[Great Citadel of Hellish Difficulties]] expanded Error Chain before Universal Error, containing grand total of 14 difficulties which only 9 got into the wiki. In Early 2021 Error Chain was introduced to EJT wiki, which the chain expanded once again including more that 10 difficulties aswell first time including sub-difficulties and difficulties spanning above Black Hole Error. After some while later there was a purge for the chain in March 2022 atleast one third of Error Chain got deleted, including the chain ot expanded to transcendentally Impossible category. There was more purges that Error Chain was but ended surviving all of the purges. Currently there are total of 8 difficulties spanning physically impossible to logically impossible.
