''This difficulty belongs to [[LIA's Babass FamiIy]] (LIABF / LBF). The LBF is inspired by RagingEngineer's [[Babass dficuklty]] and shouldn't be considered an imposter at all levels. No pages upon the LBF are purposed to be in need for any sort of deletion or hatred. If you dislike the LBF, that's fine even if you like it.''
==What is [[File:ShatteredBabass.png|frameless|51x51px]] '''<span style="color: #aa00ff;">Shattered Babass</span>'''?==
[[File:ShatteredBabass.png|frameless|30x30px]] '''<span style="color: #aa00ff;">Shattered Babass</span>''' is a Class 0 Difficulty coming before {{Class0Difficulties|Automatic|30px}} [[Automatic]] but is after [[File:Unlosable new.png|frameless|30x30px|]] [[Unlosable]], [[File:Roll Difficulty.png|30px]] [[Unlosable/Old#Roll|Roll]] or [[File:Mazeophobia.jpg|30px]] [[Unlosable/Old#Mazeophobia|Mazeophobia]] This difficulty is the second last automatic difficulty behind obviously {{Class0Difficulties|Automatic|30px}} [[Automatic]]. [[File:ShatteredBabass.png|frameless|30x30px]] '''<span style="color: #aa00ff;">Shattered Babass</span>''' is basically too easy so just skip to Class 1, or even Class 2, but if you ACTUALLY SUCK then stay here for now, actually you know what, skip to {{Class0Difficulties|Automatic|30px}} [[Automatic]] . There is no reason to be on this sub-difficulty (if you aren't in a DCT, that is).

==Moving On==
Go to {{Class0Difficulties|Automatic|30px}} [[Automatic]] as it’s the next difficulty. Beyond this point, automacy is not helping you so will need to start moving. You can skip to something like [[File:New icon Delight.png|frameless|30x30px]] [[Delightful]] or [[File:EffortlesslessIconOoIDC.png|frameless|30x30px]] [[Effortlessless]] or even [[File:EasyDifficulty.jpg|frameless|30x30px]] [[w:c:jtoh:Easy|Easy]] if you want a challenge.

Whatever you want to do is your choice. If you don't like what your up to doing, then you can [[The First Difficulty|quit the chart]] and do something else like play Welcome To Bloxburg (if you have the robux anyways), Minecraft (if you have the money anyways) or some other game you enjoy.{{DifficultiesNavbox}}
