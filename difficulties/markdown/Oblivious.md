# Oblivious

Oblivious is a sub-difficulty of Anguish, positioned just before The Human Limit. It represents the final test before reaching the absolute limit of genuine, possible difficulties. Obstacles may seem manageable at first, but the true challenge becomes apparent as players progress. Beyond this point, tool-assisted strategies become necessary, and only the most dedicated can hope to advance further.
