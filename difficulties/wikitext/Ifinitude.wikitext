==<center>A Remembrance</center>==

The ifinite chain (based on a pun of the word infinite) was a chain that once existed in [[:Category:Class Negative|Class Negative]], created by [[User:Loganboi2|Loganboi2]] on 5th October 2020. The difficulties that were part of it were:

*[[File:Longifinite.png|30px]] [[Ifinite-Ifinite-Easy-Ifinite-Easy-Alpha-Easy-Null-Ifinite|Ifinite-Ifinite-Easy-Ifinite-Easy-Alpha-Easy-Null-Ifinite]]
*[[File:Ifinite-Dot.png|30px]] [[Ifinite-Dot|Ifinite-Dot]]
*[[File:IIIrevamp.png|30px]] [[User blog:Loganboi2/Ifinite-Ifinite-Ifinite|Ifinite-Ifinite-Ifinite]]
*[[File:DISCOIE.png|30px]] [[User blog:Loganboi2/Disco-Ifinite-Easy|Disco-Ifinite-Easy]]
*[[File:Ifinite-easy2.png|30px]] [[User blog:Loganboi2/Ifinite-Easy|Ifinite-Easy]]

All of these pages have been a long-standing piece of JJT's history until they were removed for being largely useless. With the expansion of Class Negative and the splitting of Class Negative between the Upper and Lower regions, this difficulty intends to bring at least a piece of the ifinite chain back into the chart. They only exist now in the CDC.

==<center>Introduction</center>==
Ifinitude is a sub-difficulty of [[File:Vintage.png|30px]] [[Vintage]] that lies between Vintage and [[File:Justairrevamprevamp.png|30px]] [[Just Air]]. The difficulty is currently in Class 0, and like other difficulties in this class, you do not have to do anything to complete it. That's right, you don't even need to touch your keyboard once you enter the structure, theres also an INFINITUDE alternate ways to win it. The difficulty is a remembrance of the ifinite chain that had existed since 2020 but has now since graved.

The difficulty as said above is extremely easy, if this difficulty was in a difficulty chart tower, Ifinitude would only be showing up for a few seconds before passing to the next floor which would be [[File:Justairrevamprevamp.png|30px]] [[Just Air]].

==<center>Continuing On</center>==
The difficulty only lasts a few meaningless seconds on the scale of a whole difficulty chart, but it is one to remember. The difficulty is a pretty insignificant challenge compared to many other difficulties but completing anything, no matter how easy it is, is an accomplishment in itself. So congratulations on completing the Ifinitude, [[File:Justairrevamprevamp.png|30px]] [[Just Air]] is currently the next difficulty in line.
