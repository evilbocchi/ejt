<h2>What is [[File:Mega Death Error Collapse Blood Ultra Galaxy Spatial System Galaxy Corrupt Horror Frightening Impossible XD Difficulty.jpg|frameless|35px]] '''<span class="MegaDeath">MegaDeath</span>?'''</h2>
[[File:Mega Death Error Collapse Blood Ultra Galaxy Spatial System Galaxy Corrupt Horror Frightening Impossible XD Difficulty.jpg|30px]] '''<span class="MegaDeath">MegaDeath</span>''' is the well known difficulty of EJT that concludes [[:category:Class 7|Class 7]] in the Main Difficulty Chart. It is associated with obstacles impossible even with TAS as a result of its precise complexity and unimaginable tasks the obbyist face. In many famous Difficulty Charts, like [[Obelisk of Endless Difficulty Amplifying|OoEDA]] , it has been well associated with fast-moving instant kill spinners, tight lodges, moon wallhops, and all the other unique obstacles you could think of.

As a result, it is one of the more excruciating difficulties that far surpasses the new height of obstacles mentioned in the first paragraph. An obbyist would require inhuman skill and luck, of course, but as well as a mind that can process inhumanely to escape the extremes in the obstacles. Megadeath is the real deal, its obstacles are something to prepare for despite what you may have already accomplished. It would be a fool of you, or anyone to ignore the seriousness that is Megadeath. So, good luck player, as your environment around you will forever change into what is reality.  
<h2>Icon Representation</h2>
[[File:Mega Death Error Collapse Blood Ultra Galaxy Spatial System Galaxy Corrupt Horror Frightening Impossible XD Difficulty.jpg|30px]] '''<span class="MegaDeath">MegaDeath</span>''' has a very complicated icon, yet simple to unravel. There are four Roblox decals that includes a group of different Roblox characters near the corner of the icon. Next to them, there are four human skulls, which represents the insanity and mortality that is inevitably faced when attempting '''MegaDeath'''.

In the middle, there is a transparent Greek letter iota, with an evil smiley face layered on top. Looking carefully, the smiley face consists of two-digit numbers on it to resemble it's absurdity and randomness. Surrounding the iota and smiley face is a pentagram, of course, to resemble its demonizing attributes.

And of course, how could you forget the zalgo text found hidden in the back of the skulls and Roblox avatars?

<h2>Trivia</h2>
*This difficulty was the only difficulty after TDEx got demotion to a normal difficulty.
**After sometime, {{PAGENAME}} promoted to [[:Category:Fabled Difficulty|Fabled]] due popularity and importance is.
*{{PAGENAME}} is a well-known Difficulty following [[File:SquareSupreme.png|30px]] [[Supreme]] and a couple of others due to its iconic importance in Prime EJT.
<h3>When {{PAGENAME}} was Legendary </h3>
*Megadeath used to be the second legendary difficulty on the Main DC, until later being confirmed by Sanjay2133 that it no longer sustains its status.
*Since MegaDeath used to be a legendary floor, Difficulty Chart Towers gave a special floor/frame enlargement by 500 x 500 studs. This is true for the rest of the legendary difficulties. There, however, is exception to this in [[Great Citadel of Custom, Impossible, and Normal Difficulties|GCoCIaND]] where the frame is 250 x 250 studs.
*[[Difficulty Button Simulator]] was the first game to introduce layers for this difficulty. Later, it became a trend for [[Difficulty Chart]] towers.

<h2>Continuing from this point.</h2>
Through impossible jumps, precarious spinners, horrible deaths, lucky flings, and whatever hellish complexities you have faced, you have conquered the Class 7 finale, and an ex-legendary difficulty.  Your great victory will be remembered throughout history in the Obbyist Community. You may have won this battle, but of course, you haven't won the war. You've still got a long way ahead of you, kiddo. You can either continue, or you can quit. Perhaps, you'd like to do [[File:Epitome.png|30px]] [[Epitome]]. If you think you're prepared: go for it. I would say good luck, but there’s not a point to that, now is there?{{MainDifficultiesNavbox}}[[Category:Class 7]][[Category:Difficulties]][[Category:Difficulty]][[Category:Physically Impossible]][[Category:Large Pages]]
