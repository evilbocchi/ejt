# Epic (EToH)

Epic is a joke difficulty added in the April Fools 2020 Event. It is represented by the color dockside blue. This difficulty was removed at the end of the event. There were only 3 event towers with this difficulty. Epic has the widest difficulty range out of any difficulty in the game, from just climbing a truss all the way to Floor 10 to having a non-functioning winpad.
