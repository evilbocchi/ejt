==What is '''Dissonant'''?==
'''Dissonant''' is a High Class 5 difficulty, transcending beyond [[File:DESTRUCTIVE.png|frameless|30x30px]] '''[[Destructive]]''' and sitting below [[File:Mischievous.png|frameless|30x30px]] '''[[Mischievous]]'''. In '''Dissonant''', obstacles you will encounter are unfathomably hard, to the point that they are infeasible to attempt in the first place. These jumps incorporate severe RNG into them, along with inhuman levels of skill and precision. Just one microscopic mistake could cost you tons of progress. This difficulty shall not be beaten by any human, let alone attempted for that matter.

'''Dissonant''' is estimated to be Tier 47-48 in tiers, far surpassing the human limit, and putting infamously hard towers such as [[w:c:jtohs-hardest-towers:Chaotic Tower|'''Chaotic Tower''']] to shame. Even beating one obstacle of this difficulty is a great achievement that most would consider as being impossible, due to this difficulty neutralizing any TAS, forcing the usage of multiple external tools along with TAS.  

Before attempting a tower/obby of this difficulty, you should equip yourself with several helpful tools (like extra speed/jumppower,) and prepare by clearing some [[File:DESTRUCTIVE.png|frameless|30x30px]] [[Destructive]] difficulty towers/obbies.

== On from '''Dissonant'''==
"How?", you think to yourself as you reach the winpad. How did you make it out alive? How did you not give up? This was said to be an impossible feat. Then, you remember. Your journey isn't over just yet. In fact, it's nowhere close to finished. The next difficulty that awaits you is [[File:Mischievous.png|frameless|30x30px]] '''[[Mischievous]]'''. Things are getting worse and worse as you near the border of physical possibility...
