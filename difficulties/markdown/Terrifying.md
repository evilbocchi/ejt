# Terrifying

Terrifying is a Soul Crushing difficulty in EToH, represented by a turquoise/cyan 5-pointed star. It is the second hardest canon difficulty in the game. Obstacles in towers of this difficulty are even harder than those in Extreme towers, and all of these towers have very few legitimate completions.

Towers of this difficulty require a large amount of skill to beat. They are known to be extremely difficult and can take a long time to complete, making beating one a significant achievement.
