[[Absurd]] is a [[:Category:Class 3|Low-Mid Class 3]] difficulty made by [[User:TasmanianRex|TasmanianRex]]. This difficulty is placed between {{Class3Difficulties|Extreme|20px}} [[w:c:jtoh:Extreme|Extreme]] and {{Class3Difficulties|Terrifying|20px}} [[w:c:jtoh:Terrifying|Terrifying]] difficulties. However, it used to be the ABSOLUTE borderline difficulty of [[:Category:Class 2|Class 2]] before both {{Class3Difficulties|Insane|20px}} [[w:c:jtoh:Insane|Insane]] and {{Class3Difficulties|Extreme|20px}} [[w:c:jtoh:Extreme|Extreme]] moved to [[:Category:Class 3|Class 3]] along with their sub difficulties. Any difficulties that is designed to be harder than this difficulty will be placed above {{Class3Difficulties|Extreme|20px}} [[w:c:jtoh:Extreme|Extreme]]. Instead, these difficulties required a lot of practice for elite obbyists to acquire this achievement.

Obstacles on this difficulty required advanced techniques and precise positioning to pass. [[Absurd]] difficulty {{jtoh|Tower|Towers}} are time consuming, punishing and challenging for emerging elite players. They can take tons of time and effort to beat these towers, eventually giving up to move on. The player should practice a lot before attempting any [[Absurd]] difficulty towers.

==Obstacles==
{{jtoh|Tower|Towers}} on this difficulty uses various glitches, punishments and length in attempt to waste player’s time. They also have a variety of jumps such as ladder and truss jumps, utilisation of glitches and wacky obstacles. Length is a factor on this difficulty, typically punishing the player by teleporting to a previous floor using teleporters. Nonetheless, this difficulty should not punish the player harshly by not inserting instakill bricks and tricky jumps without safety nets in this situation. Normal glitches such as corner flipping (which required a script to work), dance clipping and wallhopping could be used for these {{jtoh|Tower|Towers}} at this level, especially when these glitches are used unusually. This is the level where other known glitches are introduced: laugh clipping (easy version), lag clipping, head gliding, highjumping (both normal and cheer variants) and ladder clipping. This forces players to pick up new glitches along their journey when they occur for the first time.

For example, the {{jtoh|ToTDA|Tower of The Dripping Amalgam}} utilises ladder jumps, glitches and regular jumps creatively. As you seen from floor 5, there are many unusual ladder jumps, normally indicated as darker shades to guide the player where they supposed to jump. This is to prevent the player from guessing and allow them to see the indication. Not only it uses regular jumps, it also uses client-sided obstacles. Alongside with the {{jtoh|ToCF|Tower of Conflicting Frontiers}}, these towers uses jump boost pads in a  innovative way. Another example would be the {{jtoh|ToFN|Tower of Frightening Nightmares}} as it has a variety of jumps. This {{jtoh|Tower}} uses orientation in attempt the make these jumps feel new and not repetitive to the player. It is a good advise to make your obstacles look odd and new as seen from this example when you are creating your first {{jtoh|Tower}}.

Not only you are making a {{jtoh|Tower}} with this difficulty, it helps you to create excellent towers in the future and have a positive impact for your community. On the other hand, you should use these glitches when you are creating a {{jtoh|SC|Soul Crushing Tower}}. If you want to build a high-quality {{jtoh|Tower}}, you can learn at #building-tutorials channel in JToH discord. If building {{jtoh|Tower|Towers}} is not your hobby, it helps you to build better obbies and allows you to build more ambitious projects in the future.

==Trivia==
*This difficulty first appeared in the [[Obelisk of Endless Difficulty Amplifying]] and later was to be used in future [[Difficulty Chart]] [[:Category:Towers|towers]]. 
**However, it stopped being used for these types of [[:Category:Towers|towers]].
**Floor 19.5 was never built on [[Obelisk of Endless Difficulty Amplifying]] despite the revamp works.
*'''Absurd''' was deleted due to low quality like other difficulties.
*The quote on this article was a reference of [[Obelisk of Endless Difficulty Amplifying|OoEDA]]'s floor 19.75.
*Unlike other difficulties, this difficulty do not show the rough estimate of the obstacles. Instead, it explain through detail on what they may look like.
**This is to prevent obstacles to being misaligned for the 0.5 or 1 stud grid and further annoyance with design.
*The old icon was blueish in color and it was used on [[Obelisk of Endless Difficulty Amplifying|OoEDA]].
*This is (probably) [[User:TasmanianRex|TasmanianRex]]'s last difficulty.<ref>The difficulty's [https://jtohs-joke-towers.fandom.com/f/p/4400000000000080077 announcement].</ref>
*This difficulty will be added on [[Monolith of Deadly Difficulties Approaching|MoDDA]].
**Recently, [[User:Turbomaxwel|Turbomaxwel]] announced that this difficulty will be added to [[Monolith of Deadly Difficulties Approaching|MoDDA]].<ref>[https://jtohs-joke-towers.fandom.com/wiki/Monolith_of_Deadly_Difficulties_Approaching?commentId=4400000000000081973&replyId=4400000000000240473 Announcement] made by the creator of [[Monolith of Deadly Difficulties Approaching|MoDDA]].</ref>
*It was revived after seven months of its deletion. 
**Even more, it was first created one year ago and deleted in seven months of its existence.
*This difficulty was in [[Images of Deleted Difficulties|IoDD]] before it was revived.
*'''Absurd''' ’s version in JCC wiki was different completely. You can check this article [[w:c:jtohs-custom-chart:Absurd|here]].
**Comparing with the icons, JJT's icon has a simple cyan background whereas JCC’s version has a black face with a darker blue background. Note that it was also placed between {{Class3Difficulties|Insane|20px}} [[w:c:jtoh:Insane|Insane]] and {{Class3Difficulties|Extreme|20px}} [[w:c:jtoh:Extreme|Extreme]] difficulties.
*This difficulty used to be placed at [[:Category:Class 2|Skyline Class 2]].
