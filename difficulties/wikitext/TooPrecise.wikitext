{{Class10Difficulties|TooPrecise}}<span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:100%;background:-webkit-linear-gradient(45deg, #222222,#555555);-webkit-background-clip:text;-webkit-text-fill-color:transparent;">'''<u>TooPrecise</u>'''</span> is the final Class 7 (sub)-difficulty, the only sub-difficulty of {{Class10Difficulties|MegaDeath}}'''[[MegaDeath|<span style="background:linear-gradient(90deg,red,#FF0000,#FFFF00,#FF0000,red); -webkit-background-clip:text !important; -webkit-text-fill-color:transparent;">MegaDeath</span>]]'''. It can be found in [[Obelisk of Endless Difficulty Amplifying]] as <s>a secret.</s>    

It requires the player to conquer obstacles that are, like its name, ''too precise''. There are no mistakes to be made (if they even could be). Now, imagine a difficulty so unimaginably hard that you'll spend hours, days, or even ''weeks'', ''<u>months</u>'' or <u>'''''years'''''</u> on comprehending its tech-y trials, only to fail at the first jump. 

Being a sub-difficulty of {{Class10Difficulties|MegaDeath}}'''[[MegaDeath|<span style="background:linear-gradient(90deg,red,#FF0000,#FFFF00,#FF0000,red); -webkit-background-clip:text !important; -webkit-text-fill-color:transparent;">MegaDeath</span>]]''', a [[Legendary Difficulties List|Legendary Difficulty]] notorious for its questionable difficulty of obstacles, this is actually true. Adding on, it is very slightly harder than it, which is already pretty stupid.

Most builds underrate the true difficulty of this. Therefore, an fully accurate representation of the difficulty is hard to come by.

Even though the difficulty may be completed significantly quicker than others of this class, its insanely complicated schemes will definitely put a dent in the player's ability to continue. (Definitely.) (100%) (Yeah, the player will ''totally'' not get past this. Absolutely nothing of the sort will happen.)

==Endless, obligatory descriptions of hardness:==
<u>INFINITE.</u> Once you start, you can't stop. No pauses, no breaks, nothing. Of course, you can always give up and reset. (it's recommended...)

<u>PERFECTION.</u> The difficulty is so precise that missing a jump by even 0.0000001s of a stud will insta-kill you. And ruin your universe. And destroy it. ''Ten times over.''

<u>CONFUSION.</u> The obstacles in this difficulty are also usually exceedingly difficult to comprehend, with OoEDA's floor even needing to have a color chart of the types of obstacles. You can match with the obstacles to determine their type and how you should go with getting past them, in order to lift some of the confusion. Even then, they are supremely confusing.

<u>UNCONVENTIONALITY.</u> Tech, yes- Unconventional glitches, awkward jumps, questionable jank and excessive claustrophobia. Of course, this is essentially a super-buffed version of them all, amalgamated into a single floor, a hundred by hundred.

However, this difficulty is <u>mostly theoretically possible</u>, due to its lack of normal obstacles (e.g. long jumps, wraps...) It mostly consists of weird and obscure glitches.

{{Quote|speaker=- you, probably|quote=doesn't this page seem a little off-kilter?}}And... we'll get into that pretty soon. The thing is... there's someone here.

|There really isn't much to comment here.   

*It's all black. No text, no gradients, nothing. It's like closing your eyes.

|This is going to be pretty long, due to the icon's glitchy-looking and complicated nature. Sorry about that.      
* You can see how the icon is mostly monochrome, and how it looks glitchy, or corrupted even.
*There is definitely some color, it is not very obvious. One example is the small red truss near the center. Another example is the dark shade of blue near it.
*You can clearly see the texture of studs, in varying sizes and angles. Some are overlayed on top of another.
*Not so obvious is the presence of gears here, except the one in the center, which has a bumpy stud texture. They are semi-transparent and scattered all over the icon.
*There are multiple white lines which also seem to reverse the color of the image.

After completing two legendary difficulties, a break is what you deserved, but instead you got this. And, beyond all comprehension, you actually managed to win a fight against that one difficulty which is way, way ''too precise'' for anyone. I must congratulate you, for somehow managing to get this far. Now, you have a few choices. 

One, to move on to the Death Chain, which contain multiple variations of {{Class10Difficulties|MegaDeath}}'''[[MegaDeath|<span style="background:linear-gradient(90deg,red,#FF0000,#FFFF00,#FF0000,red); -webkit-background-clip:text !important; -webkit-text-fill-color:transparent;">MegaDeath</span>]]''', each with their own quirks and special ways in giving you that "most painful experience" in obbies that you've always dreamed of.

Second, to move on to the first class 11 difficulty. That's right. We're talking about [[File:Epitome.png|25px]][[Epitome|<span style="background:linear-gradient(90deg,#222222,#777777,#222222); -webkit-background-clip:text !important; -webkit-text-fill-color:transparent;">Epitome</span>]]! I'm sure that this your end. I mean, class 11. That's ten plus one... The difficulties only get exponentially harder from here onwards, so <u>good luck surviving</u>! (this is sarcasm)

<font color="#999999"><code>Do I look sarcastic to you?</code></font>

==What did we really want from all this?==
<font color="#999999"><code>I don't know what to think about this, whole situation. I guess something will eventually happen, but when will it be then?</code></font>

(...)

<font color="#999999"><code>Well. I think I should go now. I really have to. An apology for everything before this, and this will be our golden farewell. I hope you have fun.<br />A good bye.</code></font>

{{Quote (IPeedMyPants' Version)|quote=And the long-awaited golden farewell has concluded. I know you're looking, true or not. The person I've been waiting for. And if you're really not, you eventually will. Right? And I right, or left? (heh...) 
I believe that something will eventually happen. Something good. Something desirable... something that I wish to happen. But it wouldn't matter anyways. I'm here, but not at the same time. I'm existing but missing at the same time. It's all because of that... wretched one. Do you know him? I don't really. I probably don't at all. I probably don't know who I truly am. I probably am just dreaming. All that time perception psychology. Alice in wonderland syndrome. Who knows? Not me, probably.|quoter=Abendregen}}

==Trivia?==     
* This was originally a non-approved Class 24 difficulty.
*This was revamped by Phaxyi. (although he doesn't want to claim ownership because this is so unbelievably edgy and he's thinking Hey I might as well make this even edgier Stay tuned OoEDA EDGY REVAMP!)
*(i believe) The first ever demonstration of <span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:100%;background:-webkit-linear-gradient(45deg, #222222,#555555);-webkit-background-clip:text;-webkit-text-fill-color:transparent;">'''<u>{{Class10Difficulties|TooPrecise}}</u>'''</span> <span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:100%;background:-webkit-linear-gradient(45deg, #222222,#555555);-webkit-background-clip:text;-webkit-text-fill-color:transparent;">'''<u>TooPrecise</u>'''</span> was made by exyiel. It is the secret final difficulty of OoEDA.
*There is actually a cheeky hidden in OoEDA's TooPrecise floor. See if you can find it. (Hint: It's ''too precise''.)
*This is one of many difficulties that have a "Too" as the first three letters of its name.
*The gears are from geometry dash.
