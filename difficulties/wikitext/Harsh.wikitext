[[File:Harsh.png|30x30px]] '''Harsh''' is one of the last challenges you will find in Class 2, hence it is located in Peak Class 2, and despite it being made in pixel art, it is not a pixel art chain difficulty. It is a sub of [[File:Psycho.png|30x30px|link=Psycho]] [[Psycho]], formerly [[File:Relentless2.png|frameless|30x30px]] [[Relentless]], and is located between its main difficulty and {{Class2Difficulties|Relentless|30px}} [[Relentless]]. This difficulty is similar to Relentless and/or Psycho, and in case you still don’t understand the placement of this, there is another explanation for it.

There is a big gap between [[File:Psycho.png|30x30px]] [[Psycho]] and {{Class2Difficulties|Relentless|30px}} [[Relentless]]. [[File:Harsh.png|30x30px]] '''Harsh''' fills this gap.

As the name suggests, this difficulty contains harsh and grueling gameplay, which requires obbyists attempting this to put on formidable effort. As such, this difficulty is insurmountable to the average obbyist. It is even harsher for mobile players, as this difficulty is borderline impossible for even the best mobile obbyists.             

Even before attempting this, it is recommended to practice [[File:Psycho.png|30x30px]] [[Psycho]] difficulty towers, and often having to take days of practice into consideration in this difficulty.

In the middle is a white >:/ emoticon, yet again in pixel art.

*This was waiting on approval from YataDev (since it was a sub of Relentless at its beginning). 
**It, obviously, got approved.
*This would’ve originally been after Angerable, but TDE changed his mind.
*Thanks to the 7th Armageddon, Harsh is no longer a sub of {{Class2Difficulties|Relentless|30px}} [[Relentless]], instead, it is a sub of [[File:Psycho.png|30x30px|link=Psycho]] [[Psycho]].
==Continuing on==
Good job, player. You are nearly out of Class 2, and nearly out of the normal difficulty zone. Not far from this is {{Class3Difficulties|Insane|30px}} [https://jtoh.fandom.com/wiki/Insane Insane], which is the first Soul Crushing Difficulty. There isn’t a need to move onto the Soul Crushings, as anything post-Meshuga will never be required for you to progress in JToH. However, if you’re planning to move onto Caleb’s Soul Crushing Domain, you should practice this difficulty and anything beyond before moving there.
