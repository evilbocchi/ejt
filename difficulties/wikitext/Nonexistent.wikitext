==What is Nonexistent?==
Nonexistent is a Low Class 6 Difficulty and is in the 2nd last road of pseudo difficulties. Nonexistent is unbearably hard, which is to be expected. Because of this, you need a ton of practice. Before stepping foot in this difficulty, it is expected that you beat a tower of the previous difficulty, [[REEE... !!!]]. This will be great practice for Nonexistent and for the future. Also, fun fact, Nonexistent has so many wallhops and gaps that somebody made a nonexistent tower that was completely purist. It is a nearly guaranteed that every difficulty from Nil and above will have killbricks, so making a Class 6 difficulty without any killbricks is impossibly difficult to create. This also means that Nonexistent ''can be'' skill based. Sure, there’s a lot of RNG still, but at least you don’t have to rely on God’s luck to win.

==Icon Representation==
The icon for Nonexistent is a desaturated image of teletubbies. There are 4 teletubbies walking down on a bright sunny day, but they are completely greyed out. It’s supposed to give a depressing vibe by the dark colors. To be honest, it looks like what your copy looks like. There isn’t too much here, so this section will be ended.

==Obstacles ==

*13.95 - 14.25 stud wraps.
*16.5 - 17 stud jumps.
*Two invisible spinning wallhops in a row.
