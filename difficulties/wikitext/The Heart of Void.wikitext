== What is '''Heart Of Void'''? ==
The '''Heart Of Void''' is a [[:Category:Class 4|Baseline Class 4]] humanly impossible [[:Category:Sub-Difficulties|Sub-Difficulty]] made by [[User:Real The Gamer|Real The Gamer]]. It is harder than [[w:c:jtohs-hardest-towers:nil|nil]] or [[Jank]] but easier than [[w:c:jtohs-hardest-towers:Error|eRRoR]]. Obstacles in this difficulty require near-perfect precision and skill, which is why towers of this difficulty are not recommended to attempt without the use of items.

This difficulty used to be the transitioning point between [[w:c:jtohs-hardest-towers:nil|nil]] and [[w:c:jtohs-hardest-towers:Error|eRRoR]]. However, newer difficulties such as [[Nightmare]] were made which took that position away from '''Heart Of Void.''' Also it is a sub dificulty from [[w:c:jtohs-hardest-towers:Error|eRRoR]].
