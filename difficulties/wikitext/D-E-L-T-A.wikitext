==What is [[File:D-E-L-T-A Revamped Icon.png|45x45px]] <span id="delta">D-E-L-T-A</span>?==
[[File:D-E-L-T-A Revamped Icon.png|25px]] <span id="delta">D-E-L-T-A</span> is the second difficulty in the [[:Category:Mike's Difficulty Chart Chain|MrXY201's Difficulty chart]]. It's right after [[File:Xi-Alpha Icon.png|25px]] [[Xi-Alpha]], and is before [[File:≈∏ revamp icon.png|25px]] [[√ø|≈∏]] on this sub-path. It's considered to be one of the original Post-Supreme difficulties, and has a surprisingly big legacy to it. Obstacles in this difficulty are basically Supreme jumps buffed by a significant margin, and require an infinite amount of patience and pixel perfect timing to complete. This difficulty is also the start of the Sub-Path, containing this difficulty as well as  [[File:≈∏ revamp icon.png|25px]] [[√ø|≈∏]], as opposed to directly jumping into [[File:ThetaVoidRevamp.png|25px]] [[Theta-Void]].

|Current
|June<br>16th, 2024
|rowspan="2"|This version of the icon has a chartreuse (yellow-green) Greek uppercase delta 'Œî' with the appearance of a crystal in the middle, a small turquoise star just below the middle glowing with a blurry lens flare, smaller points of light around the star, and a darker turquoise star vortex around the edges of the icon. This version was created with the permission of [[w:c:jtohs-joke-towers:User:Viranenthusiast|Viranenthusiast]] to make the difficulty icon more readable since the similar chartreuse and turquoise in the Classic icon made it difficult to see the icon properly on small sizes, especially since there was little contrast between foreground and background, and the icon itself didn't age well.

|Classic
|August<br>18th, 2021
|rowspan="2"|This version of the icon is simple, having a blue-green glow going white. There is also a yellow-green triangle that isn't filled in on top; in other words, the ‚àÜ symbol. Simple but effective.

|Old
|September<br>24th, 2020
|rowspan="2"|This version of the icon is a yellow sky originating from Roblox with an uncentered approximated Greek uppercase delta 'Œî'. The icon looks a little ugly, but its age makes it justifiable.
