[[File:New icon Delight.png|frameless|35x35px]] <span style="color: #ffffba;">'''Delightful'''</span> is a Class 1 sub-difficulty that was born from [[File:Epic face.png|frameless|25x25px]] ''Happy'' as a recommended replacement image turned into a difficulty, it's one of the high Class 1 difficulties having [[File:Tutorial.png|35x35px]] '''[[Tutorial]]''' be its previous (and main) difficulty, and [[File:TooEasy Difficulty Revamped.jpg|30px]] '''[[TooEasy]]''' as its next difficulty. You can also notice that this is a sub-difficulty of [[File:Tutorial.png|35x35px]] '''[[Tutorial]].''' Oh yeah right, you got to probably start doing 0.3 stud wraps as you do [[File:Piece O Cake UHD.jpeg|30px]] [[Piece o' Cake|'''Piece o' Cake''']] gameplay but with a healthy amount of "harder gameplay" added to it, Good luck!
