<br>[[File:Rewardable diff.png|frameless|30x30px]] <span style="background:linear-gradient(#CD853F,#8b4513); -webkit-background-clip:text !important; -webkit-text-fill-color:transparent;">'''Rewardable'''</span> is a sub difficulty that is located in Low Class 2. This difficulty lands in-between [[File:Intermediate.png|frameless|30x30px]] '''[[Intermediate]]''' and {{Class1Difficulties|Hard}} [[w:c:jtoh:Hard|Hard]]. It was created, and is still being created, on 6/27/2022 by '''OqYTRXD'''.

This difficulty is one of the friendliest difficulties, unmatched by any other nice difficulties. The reason why this difficulty has that rank is because of a special ability it has: the shop. 

Every obstacle the player attempts will give the player points. The number of points you get depends on whether you attempted or completed the obstacle. The points allow you to buy things that can help you to continue your difficulty journey. However, there is a downside to it. Every ability that pitches in with the player will NOT last long. Once the player dies, their ability will no longer help them. To get the ability back, you will have to beat even more other obstacles, and you can buy it again.

Whether you’re attempting a [[room]], floor, [[w:c:jtoh:Steeple|steeple]], [[w:c:jtoh:Tower|tower]], etc, this difficulty is really easy to do. Accomplishing this difficulty requires basic problem solving and fast trials. So, in this difficulty, that is essentially it. We shall move on.

The icon first represents has a wood brown color to be as the main background. A black bean (not sure) color on every corner of the icon. And a pale brown color represents the border of the icon. All of the border color will combine and become a lighter color, to make a second and third border. And lastly, A friendly happy smile that is look alike {{Class0Difficulties|Peaceful}} '''[[Peaceful]]''' in the middle of the icon. The icon was really made in pixel.

==Coming to another Difficulty==
You submit this difficulty. Congratulations on beating [[File:Rewardable diff.png|frameless|30x30px]] <span style="background:linear-gradient(#CD853F,#8b4513); -webkit-background-clip:text !important; -webkit-text-fill-color:transparent;">'''Rewardable'''</span>! After beating this difficulty, move on to {{Class1Difficulties|Hard}} [[w:c:jtoh:Hard|Hard]]. Which there would be tougher obstacles to attempt. Not really friendly to newbie players. As it results, some of your potions left over will be maintained in your inventory. Keep it in your inventory and go through your journey. But as {{Class1Difficulties|Hard}} [[w:c:jtoh:Hard|Hard]], jumps are bigger and even more challenging obstacles. Not really a lot of people would mess it up. Going through with the forms of obstacles would result from a harsh. The only tough player will continue their risks.
==Trivia!== 

* The icon of this difficulty was originally white color. With a black smile. Since it didn't get save, this is the new icon.
*This difficulty would probably fit perfectly as a shopping difficulty. Probably add it in an RPG or Button simulator.
*The icon is combined from {{Class0Difficulties|Peaceful}} '''[[Peaceful]]''' and [[File:Autism but resized.png|frameless|30x30px]] '''[[Autism]].'''
