# Gingerbread

Gingerbread is a miscellaneous difficulty and serves as the placeholder difficulty of EToH. It is represented by a gingerbread man and uses the color brown for the difficulty chart and win messages. Gingerbread became known as a placeholder for the monthly tower "Tower of Is Steeple Crossing Required?" and originated as an inside joke among staff during the judging of the Garden of Eesh√∂l submissions, where gingerbread GIFs were posted when a difficulty could not be decided.

Despite its humorous origin, Gingerbread is considered a semi-official difficulty. Towers with the Gingerbread difficulty that are challenging enough may have their wins displayed in the #sc-tower-winners channel of the official EToH Discord server. During the 2022 Winter Event, the Gingerbread Guardians team logo featured a gingerbread man holding the Gingerbread icon.
