# Godlike

Godlike is a High Class 8, physically impossible difficulty, located between Errorisation and Esoteric. Rated 86.5, it is essentially a buffed version of Omega. Even a single jump in this difficulty is nearly impossible, and building a tower at this level is a significant achievement. Godlike is designed to be a barrier, discouraging players from progressing further due to its extreme challenge.

The obstacles in Godlike are meant to hinder and demotivate players, rather than stop them entirely. The difficulty is so high that any attempt to complete it is considered futile. Godlike is a test of endurance and determination, pushing players to their limits and beyond.
