# PUMPKINDEATH

PUMPKINDEATH is an event difficulty in Class 30, making it one of the hardest collaboration difficulties. It is harder than Uncomputable and Effortful, and is themed around Halloween. Every obstacle is loaded with nightmares and impossibilities, using numbers and challenges that defy logic. PUMPKINDEATH is a celebration of the most extreme and spooky challenges.
