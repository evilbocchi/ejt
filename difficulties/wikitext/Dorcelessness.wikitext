[[File:DorcelessnessDifficulty.png|30x30px]] '''<big>Dorcelessness</big>''' is a Difficulty that is not found inside of '''JToH.''' This is the difficulty that resides between [[File:Eccentric.PNG|15x15px]] [[Eccentric]] and [[File:Horrific Updated.webp|15x15px]] [https://jtohs-hardest-towers.fandom.com/wiki/Horrific Horrific]. It is meant to border the 2 difficulties, while also containing towers from the peak of the [[File:CatastrophicDifficulty.jpg|15x15px]] [https://jtohs-hardest-towers.fandom.com/wiki/Catastrophic Catastrophic] difficulty. It is represented by a light pink square surrounded by many triangles with varying shades of pastel pink. With the center being displayed with many small cracks in a stained glass like pattern.

This difficulty contains some extremely difficulty jumps even the current best obbyists will struggle with. Containing many jumps that can be found within towers such as [https://jtoh.fandom.com/wiki/Tower_of_Cruel_Punishment?so=search Tower of Cruel Punishment], as well as [https://jtoh.fandom.com/wiki/Tower_of_Vacant_Hindrances?so=search Tower of Vacant Hindrances].

== Trivia ==

* The word "Dorcelessness" is a made up word from a video titled [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Td2x8s9GZlo ''BLUE_CHANNEL: THALASIN''].
**[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Td2x8s9GZlo ''BLUE_CHANNEL: THALASIN''] is an Analog Horror video by Gooseworx that, at first glance, appears to just be an old-timey commercial advertising a fantasy product dubbed ''Thalasin'', which forces you to have certain emotions, but when the second half of the video kicks in, it advertises ''Thalasin+'', which supposedly adds new emotions to your brain... but these emotions happen to distort your face into [[eldritch]] horrors, where '''Dorcelessness''' is shown on the 4th ''Thalasin+'' emotion, depicted with a mostly blackened face with one eye visible.
***Additionally, That face was used as it's icon during the time '''Dorcelessness''' was a class 15 difficulty. You can view the archived version of it [[User_blog:OlekGamer1000/Dorcelessness|here]].

== Continuing On From This Point ==
You clearly show extreme skill if you were able to conquer a structure of a difficulty this high, this is most likely your breakthrough into Class 3. Trust me, now that you've made it this far, you aren't gonna have a very good time. I suggest either moving on to [[File:Horrific Updated.webp|15x15px]] [https://jtohs-hardest-towers.fandom.com/wiki/Horrific Horrific], or if you're really feeling like suffering, but being the first person to perform a achievement this big, you could skip the difficulty entirely and move on to [[File:UnrealIconModified1003.webp|15x15px]] [https://jtohs-hardest-towers.fandom.com/wiki/Unreal Unreal].
