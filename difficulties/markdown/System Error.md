# System Error

System Error is a Class 5 difficulty that succeeds Ultimate. It is the second hardest difficulty of the True Hardest difficulties section of the Universal Difficulty Chart.

System Error is beyond the assumed limit of difficulty; meaning it is uncertain if obstacles here are humanly or physically impossible. If Citadel of Void were humanly possible and were of Ultimate difficulty, for it to be System Error, the citadel would need to be buffed to the point where the human possibility of the gameplay itself is uncertain, and be extended further to inhumane lengths.
