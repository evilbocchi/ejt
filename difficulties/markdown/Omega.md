# Omega

Omega is a difficulty much harder than Unimaginable but easier than Aleph-Null, represented by a rainbow color scheme. Obstacles are extremely obscure, and towers in this difficulty can take months or even years to verify. Omega is considered by some to be the first "physically impossible" difficulty, marking a major milestone in the chart.
