# DELETE

DELETE is a Class 6 difficulty that follows Miracle. This difficulty is relentlessâ€”getting hit by a laser results in instant failure, and a corrupted robot controls the floor, throwing impossible obstacles at the player. DELETE is dominated by a red theme and is known for its unforgiving nature. Surviving DELETE is a rare feat, and moving on means facing even greater challenges.
