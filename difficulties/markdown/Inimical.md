# Inimical

Inimical is a Class 5 sub-difficulty that is considered beyond humanly impossible. No jump in this difficulty can be completed by a human, and any attempt is futile. The challenge is intentionally designed to be impossible, making any effort to complete it a waste of time.

Inimical's icon features a red-to-black gradient with the Greek letter 'Î£' (Sigma) in the center, similar to other Class 5 difficulties. The difficulty is known for its extremely high moon wallhops, long wraps, powerful killbrick spinners, and other obstacles that are far beyond human capability. The only way to "progress" is to move on to even harder difficulties like Horrendous.
