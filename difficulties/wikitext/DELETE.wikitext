==What is Delete?==
[[File:Non-Transparent Delete.png|frameless|40x40px]] <span style="color:#000000"><span style="text-shadow: #FF0000 0px 0.5px 6px;">'''DELETE'''</span></span> is a Class 6 difficulty which is right after [[File:Miracle.png|30x30px]] [[Miracle]] in most Towers/Great Citadels it is included in. This difficulty will straight up delete you, and there’s no way to stop that. Getting hit by a laser is an instant ban and death. The floor is also ran by a corrupted robot which is impossible to destroy. This robot will be sure to throw obstacles that will surely mean your demise. If you will proceed and get deleted, all I can say is that you’ll never return.

==Icon Representation ==
DELETE’s icon has a bunch of things on it. On the background, there are many <span style="color:#B00000;">'''Dark Red'''</span> lasers arranged in a grid. Near a top, there is a triangle with <span style="color:#FF0000;">'''Red'''</span> glow on the edges. It is separated in half into two segments. One is a <span style="color:#000000"><span style="text-shadow: #FFFFFF 0px 0.5px 6px;">'''Black'''</span></span> segment and the other has nothing on it, but the other still has the <span style="color:#B22222;">'''Dark Red'''</span> laser background. At the bottom, there is text saying “DELETE,” the difficulties name. It is <span style="color:#FFFFFF;">white</span>, and has a <span style="color:#B00000;">'''Dark Red'''</span> outline surrounding it. As you can see, <span style="color:#B00000;">'''Red'''</span> mainly dominates this difficulty.

== Moving On==
After avoiding being deleted on Delete by narrowly dodging killbricks and cannons, you’ve finally made it to the end. I don’t get it. '''''WHY WILL YOU NOT BE DELETED?''''' This difficulty was sure to kill you. Did the robot not work? Whatever. It’s time to move onto even harder stuff. First off, after delete, head over to [[File:Xi-Alpha Icon.png|26px]] [[Xi-Alpha]] or [[File:Interruption.png|26px]] [[Interruption]] There, your atoms will be fully destroyed.
