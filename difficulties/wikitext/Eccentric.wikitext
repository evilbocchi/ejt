[[File:Eccentric New New.png|frameless|30x30px]] '''Eccentric''' is a High Class 3 in between {{Class3Difficulties|Catastrophic}} [[w:c:jtoh:Catastrophic|Catastrophic]] and {{Class3Difficulties|Horrific}} [[w:c:jtohs-hardest-towers:Horrific|Horrific]] that represents the high range of {{Class3Difficulties|Catastrophic}} [[w:c:jtoh:Catastrophic|Catastrophic]] to the borderline between {{Class3Difficulties|Catastrophic}} [[w:c:jtoh:Catastrophic|Catastrophic]] and {{Class3Difficulties|Horrific}} [[w:c:jtohs-hardest-towers:Horrific|Horrific]] . It is also the final difficulty before you enter the high range of class 3. Due to it's placement, this difficulty is borderline impossible, and should only be attempted by the most elite of obbyists, however, individual jumps are still manageable provided you are at a high skill level.                                  

It is recommended to practice on this difficulty as there isn't any luck related elements to it, just raw skill, either way, you will see stuff that is MUCH worse then this later down the line, but that doesn't matter right now. For now, you should just improve on your skill, and then improve in other obby related aspects like nerve control or anger management before attempting a tower of this difficulty. Good luck!

==[[File:Eccentric New New.png|frameless|40x40px]] Icon Representation==
<tabber>
Current Icon=
[[File:Eccentric New New.png|center|frameless|100x100px]]
[[File:Eccentric New New.png|frameless|30x30px]] Eccentric’s current icon is simpler than the old one, but more complex than the older one. It is a very light pink background, and there is a small white notder around it. This shows that you have almost transitioned into non-canon, but you’ve still got one challenge left.
|-|
Old Icon=
[[File:EccentricRevampIcon.png|center|frameless|100x100px]]
[[File:EccentricRevampIcon.png|frameless|30x30px]] Eccentric's current icon is a bit more complicated then the old icon, but it's still simple. It has the white from {{Class3Difficulties|Catastrophic}} [[w:c:jtoh:Catastrophic|Catastrophic]] fading into the black and pink of {{Class3Difficulties|Horrific}} [[w:c:jtohs-hardest-towers:Horrific|Horrific]], it represents the transition into {{Class3Difficulties|Horrific}} [[w:c:jtohs-hardest-towers:Horrific|Horrific]] as you keep beating harder and harder towers, entering the beginning of human impossibility.

|-|
Older Icon=
[[File:Eccentric.PNG|center|frameless|101x101px]]
[[File:Eccentric.PNG|frameless|30x30px]] Eccentric’s old icon is extremely simple, it's slightly more pink than {{Class3Difficulties|Catastrophic}} [[w:c:jtoh:Catastrophic|Catastrophic]]’s icon. It is another boring, simple background. The specific color for this difficulty is pig pink. We are slowly transitioning into [[File:HorrificDifficulty.jpg|frameless|30x30px]] [[w:c:jtohs-hardest-towers:Horrific|Horrific]], as the colors are turning pinker and pinker.
