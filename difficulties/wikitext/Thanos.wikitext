''Not to be confused with [[Thanos Tower]].''

{{Difficulty|Thanos|20px}} <span id="Thanos">'''Thanos'''</span> was a sub-difficulty represented by the color Indigo placed to the left side of [[Insane|<span id="Insane">'''Insane'''</span>]] on the Difficulty Chart, the difficulty was formerly exclusive to one Tower, [[Thanos Tower]] in [[Ring 1]]. Thanos Tower was factually High-Peak <span id="Insane">'''Insane'''</span> back then along with the difficulty being useless, which is why it was removed from the game. Since its removal, in TT's [[winroom]], there is a grave on one of the corners of the island reading "R.I.P Thanos Difficulty".

{{Header|History}}
This difficulty, similarly to [[Effortless|<span id="Effortless">'''Effortless'''</span>]] and [[nil|<span id="nil">'''nil'''</span>]], was used for one [[Tower]]. <span id="Thanos">'''Thanos'''</span> difficulty used to be a removed difficulty just like <span id="Effortless">'''Effortless'''</span>, [[Horrific|<span style="color:#070002;text-shadow:0 0 1px #070002, 0px 0px 5px #9691FF, 0px 0px 5px #9691FF">'''Horrific'''</span>]],  [[Unreal|<span style="color:#070002;text-shadow:0 0 1px #070002, 0px 0px 5px #4B00C8, 0px 0px 5px #4B00C8">'''Unreal'''</span>]] and <span id="nil">'''nil'''</span>. This difficulty used to be in between [[Extreme|<span id="Extreme">'''Extreme'''</span>]] and [[Terrifying|<span id="Terrifying">'''Terrifying'''</span>]] difficulties before Thanos Tower was nerfed to High <span id="Insane">'''Insane'''</span> difficulty. When it was nerfed, <span id="Thanos">'''Thanos'''</span> difficulty changed to be in between [[Remorseless|<span id="Remorseless">'''Remorseless'''</span>]] and <span id="Insane">'''Insane'''</span>, until it was removed. It was recently brought back with the Thanos Tower update. However, it was once again removed when "The Purple Update" arrived.<ref group="lower-alpha">More about that [https://discord.com/channels/551741409624064011/551911984149299220/895107383284617216 here].</ref> It has been removed from the difficulty chart for unknown reasons though, so it is hypothetical that it could come back before "The Purple Update" arrives.
