# Do Nothing

Do Nothing is a Class 0 difficulty that comes after Winsome and before Sleepful. As the name suggests, players are required to do absolutely nothing—not even breathe—and still manage to win. The difficulty is extremely quick, and even the slightest distraction could cause a player to miss it. Its simplicity and brevity make it a memorable starting point for new players.
