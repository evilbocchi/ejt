Although some might say this difficulty is "easy." It's not just easy, you don't even have to be near wifi for most towers of this difficulty, let alone play them. It's literally a heaven for players, if you don't count [[The First Difficulty|the start]].

==Icon Description==
The icon shows a rounded pixelated smiley with a rainbow swirl background including a faint image of a disco ball. Around the smiley there is text saying "PARTY ALL NIGHT :3".<gallery>

==Trivia==

*This difficulty's older name originally came from another wiki.
**Original can be found [[w:c:jjts-insane-difficulties:Reversed Peripherality|here]].
*The name was changed to Disco due to disagreements with the name, not relating with it being used in other wikis, rather people not liking it.
*This now has a new css!

==Continuing From This Point==
Go to [[File:SquareRelaxNew.svg|frameless|36x36px]] [[Relax]]. There is ABSOLUTELY NOTHING achieved from beating this difficulty. Heck, you could've even skipped it but had no time to do it. 

Really, you're getting forced onto the [[Relax|next difficulty]] cause you have no time to skip that, either.

Why dont you go to [[File:JoyfulDiffIcon.png|51x51px]] [[Joyful]] or {{Class1Difficulties|Effortless}} [https://jtoh.fandom.com/wiki/Effortless Effortless]? Its much better. You already beat this ''so'' ''many'' times..
