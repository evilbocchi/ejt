# Dynamix

Dynamix is the first difficulty of Class 10 and one of the last to be considered Physically Impossible. It succeeds Confusion, which is wedged between Class 9 and 10, and precedes Eshinion, a difficulty even harder than Dynamix.

As a Physically Impossible difficulty, creating an obstacle of Dynamix would require jumps spanning thousands of studs. The classification for physically impossible difficulties ranges from hundreds to millions, with Dynamix approaching the limits of Roblox's velocity system. Assists of any kind become insignificant at this level, as the obstacles are mind-numbingly complex and require techniques that are not yet fully understood. These obstacles are extremely long and would take centuries to master, even for the most skilled obbyists.

As players ascend the difficulty chart, the gaps between difficulties become enormous. Progressing from Confusion to Dynamix is like skipping from Class Negative all the way to Class 5. Dynamix can also be measured by alternative systems, such as the tier system, where it would be rated in the hundreds, or by Metris, where it would have a rating of around 1800.
