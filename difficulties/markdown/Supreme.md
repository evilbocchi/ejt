# Supreme

Supreme is a legendary difficulty located in Class 6 (or Class 9 in the Community Difficulty Chart) with a rating of 60 (or 79 in the CDC). It succeeds Ultimaniac and precedes Phi. Supreme represents the limit of difficultyâ€”the unknown boundary of what is possible in Roblox, especially with changing physics and TAS mechanics. There is no Low-Mid-High range within Supreme; it is the supreme limit of possible difficulty. Any buff would make it physically impossible.
