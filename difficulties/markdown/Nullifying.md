# Nullifying

Nullifying is a Low Class 4 difficulty situated between DEATH and HELL. As a humanly impossible difficulty, it marks the beginning of the XD Chain. Beating Nullifying requires tool-assisted strategies, as even completing half a floor is nearly impossible for humans. This difficulty is a buffed version of Insane, demanding extreme precision and perseverance.
