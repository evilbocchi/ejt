''Greetings!'' It's great to see you, {{USERNAME}}! Welcome to the first difficulty in Peak Class 1. Okay, so let's get straight to the point, I don't want to waste your time by telling you what this difficulty is, so - ''Welcome to [[File:Playful.png|frameless|30x30px]] <span style="background:linear-gradient(90deg,#76F514,#DAFF78); -webkit-background-clip:text !important; -webkit-text-fill-color:transparent;">'''Playful!'''</span>''
----[[File:Playful.png|frameless|30x30px]] <span style="background:linear-gradient(90deg,#76F514,#DAFF78); -webkit-background-clip:text !important; -webkit-text-fill-color:transparent;">'''Playful'''</span> is a difficulty that lies in the beginning of ''Peak Class'' ''1.'' This difficulty resides in-between [[File:PeacefulNew.png|frameless|30x30px]] [[Peaceful]], being a tiny bit harder than it and [[File:Magnificent Current.png|frameless|30x30px]] [[Magnificent]], being easier than it. This is like a small challenge before you enter ''Class 2''. [[File:Playful.png|frameless|30x30px]] <span style="background:linear-gradient(90deg,#76F514,#DAFF78); -webkit-background-clip:text !important; -webkit-text-fill-color:transparent;">'''Playful'''</span> represents a few easy Noob Zone obstacles that require absolutely no effort to conquer, and is a perfect difficulty for new players that are just starting out, but also for the ones that just want to practice! Everyone is welcome here.

==[[File:Playful.png|frameless|35x35px]] <span style="background:linear-gradient(90deg,#76F514,#DAFF78); -webkit-background-clip:text !important; -webkit-text-fill-color:transparent;">'''Playful'''</span> - Icon Representation! ==
Wanna know about the icon? [[File:Playful.png||frameless|30x30px]] <span style="background:linear-gradient(90deg,#76F514,#DAFF78); -webkit-background-clip:text !important; -webkit-text-fill-color:transparent;">'''Playful'''</span>'s icon represents a background with a gradient, that goes from light green from the bottom to more saturated green at the top, aka a light green to green gradient.

You can see a ":)" smiley face on the icon that is center and is also slightly tilted to the left. The said face has a tiny white outline that's transparent (It's estimated to have either 0.9 or 0.95 transparency). Lastly, there are 2 highly transparent lines on both the top and bottom parts of the icon. Overall, it's a really fitting icon for a Class 1 difficulty.

I hope you know what does "Gradient" and "Transparency" mean! Didn't bring a dictionary...

==[[File:Playful.png|frameless|35x35px]] <span style="background:linear-gradient(90deg,#76F514,#DAFF78); -webkit-background-clip:text !important; -webkit-text-fill-color:transparent;">'''Playful'''</span> - Obstacles!==
Before we head to obstacles, lemme tell you about '''Catches'''! Catches are those things that are going to help you on your journey through this difficulty, but they can also make the path to your destination way harder! Don't worry, even if a catch decreases your ''WalkSpeed'' or ''JumpPower'', it won't be permanent! Here's a list of all possible catches:

Oh, and almost forgot - there's a 100% chance that a catch will happen every 60 seconds.

===''Catches'' === 

* No worries! If you fall, there's a safety net that teleports you to the start of this difficulty.
* Your ''WalkSpeed'' might decrease by 0.5 for 10 seconds, but the chance of this catch happening is only 5%.
*Your ''JumpPower'' might decrease by 35 for 15 seconds, but the chance of that happening is only 0.1%, and while the catch is active all obstacles become 3 times easier.
*You might get a ''WalkSpeed'' boost that multiplies it by x1.5 for 30 seconds. The chance of this catch activating is 7%.

===[[File:Playful.png|frameless|35x35px]] <span style="background:linear-gradient(90deg,#76F514,#DAFF78); -webkit-background-clip:text !important; -webkit-text-fill-color:transparent;">'''Baseline Playful'''</span>===
