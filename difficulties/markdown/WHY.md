Nothing for certain can be said about this difficulty, since it is several difficulties beyond feasible reach for any obbyist today, and it likely will stay that way forever. Obstacles in towers of this difficulty would require unimaginable precision in every possible category of computer input and are borderline humanly impossible, with almost all individual jumps requiring tool assistance or even RNG manipulation.
