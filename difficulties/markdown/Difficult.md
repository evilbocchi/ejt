# Difficult

Difficult is a difficulty in EToH, represented by a bright red parallelogram. It requires more precision and skill than previous levels, introducing hidden traps, falling platforms, and more complex obstacles like 3-6 stud wraparounds and thin tightropes. Players may need to use glitches to succeed. Difficult marks a significant step up in challenge, with many towers, citadels, and steeples assigned to this rating.
