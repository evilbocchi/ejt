==What is <span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:100%;background:-webkit-linear-gradient(330deg, red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple);-webkit-background-clip:text;-webkit-text-fill-color:transparent;">'''True Ease'''? ==
[[File:True Ease (New).webp|frameless|30x30px]] <span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:100%;background:-webkit-linear-gradient(330deg, red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple);-webkit-background-clip:text;-webkit-text-fill-color:transparent;">'''[[True Ease]]'''</span> is a [[:Category:Class Negative|Class Negative]] difficulty, a complete antipode of [[File:Absolute Infinity.jpg|frameless|30x30px]] [[ABSOLUTE INFINITY]]. This is one of the easiest difficulties ever if anything exists in any universe, omniverse, and, every possible dimension, even if it's an atom in a single universe, everything wins, including everything in every different dimension. If nothing exists, everything wins, even things in every dimension.  

Even if you find a way to be in a separate state of living apart from existing and not, everything still wins, and even if there’s a tower of this difficulty in a different dimension that nothing can escape from, somehow it will find its way into every dimension, even dimensions that are not accessible and don’t exist yet, you will always win...

==Icon representation==
The icon is a white background with a colorful rainbow sun, with smiles and lines with even more smiles. This just shows how you will live; you will live colorfully.

==Obstacles in True Ease==
*Have an existence rank of η<sub>0</sub> to ω.
*Wait -Ω seconds.
*To lose this difficulty, you have to beat [[File:Absolute Infinity.jpg|frameless|30x30px]] [[ABSOLUTE INFINITY]].
*Lose an [[File:Ee.png|frameless|30x30px]] [[Effortful]] difficulty or beyond structure 5 times.

==Continuing from this point.==
I have to say, that wasn't even impressive at all. Do some more stupid Class Negative difficulties and instant win before you even reacted. Heck, you've already won {{Class-1Difficulties|A|20px}} [[A]]. What's the point in trying Class Negative?? Like I said, you've already won, please just go to [[File:EffortlessDifficulty.jpg|31x31px]] [[w:c:jtoh:Effortless|Effortless]] already...
