# Joyful

Joyful is a Class 1 difficulty created for the JET Chain, positioned between Automatic and Press a Key (or Placid). It is a legendary, humanly possible difficulty where obstacles require only a single in-game action, such as jumping or pressing a key. Most challenges are trivial, and the difficulty is rarely a challenge for players.

The icon is a shaded background, originally used in the Obelisk of Endless Difficulty Amplifying. Joyful is best skipped by experienced players, as it is designed to be simple and time-wasting. It is recommended to move on to more engaging difficulties after Joyful.
