# Skip

Skip is a High Class Negative difficulty that functions almost the same as Instant Win but way quicker. Sometimes, since it's so fast, it may even lag your game or kick you out; you already skipped this difficulty. This difficulty is absurdly easy, as it simply revolves around entering the portal and winning. Sometimes, you don't even need to enter the portal to win, since it's that easy.
