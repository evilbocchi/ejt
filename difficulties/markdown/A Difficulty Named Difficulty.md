# A Difficulty Named Difficulty

A Difficulty Named Difficulty is a difficulty between Flowerness and Pleasant. It is not particularly easy, but not so hard as to be called "Piece o' Cake." Beating towers in this difficulty can be challenging, but for experienced players, it may only take a week. It's possible to skip this difficulty entirely, as you can move to Piece o' Cake without completing any towers here.
