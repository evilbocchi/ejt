== Oh Noez! ==
Oh noez! Your computer has contracted a virus after beating [[File:Zanyte.png|30px]] [[Zany]]! Now you have to deal with this virus on your computer before you can move onto [[File:Viratical.png|30px]] [[Viratical]]. You've somehow made it past like 18 classes, and made it to the end of Class 10!

This difficulty is literally physically impossible, so good luck with that! Also don't forget that you still have the funny virus after clicking on the free bobux link. 11 classes and you still haven't learned that those things are scams? How pitiful. Your honest reaction after clicking the link would've been probably so funny! You probably were like :O and just was dumbfounded that you ''found'' that you were so ''dumb''.

Funny right? You'd think that you'd have learned from this, but now you have to do Class 10 obstacles with the worst catches ever! Don't you even dare change the DPI or get an antivirus! Your computer will explode, but your mind probably exploded first! Such an idiot, honestly. Don't you love having viruses on your computer like that?

Also don't you think it's silly that you think that you can do jumps that range quadrillions of studs? I sure did think that way. You literally look so small compared to the jump! And that jump is literally so big that it's physically impossible! And you're still literally just halfway to the end! Imagine...

The rating of this difficulty is 113. Think about that number! It's like...more than 3! That's way lower than the size of your forehead in meters! Your mind probably exploded already! And not only that, but the tier rating has to be something like 1 quadrillion! Oh yeah, and you know Metris? The rating of this in Metris is |1980|! That's like a lot!

It's your honest reaction! Surprised! This entire thing is in the best quality of ever of being incredibly pixelated! Honestly, all emojis should be like that. It's an old emoji from 2008 microsoft messenger showing your literal honest reaction of being surprised! The ball, or face, or emoji or whatever you want to call it is yellow! Yellow like joy! And the background is completely white and blank, just like the future you have when trying to complete this! And also blank like the life you still have!

Catches=
== Catches ==
Let's try some catches!
* You don't have an antivirus, and your computer has the Oh Noez, MEMZ, and the You Are An Idiot viruses! 
* If you try restarting your computer, it explodes! Don't worry, you will not be harmed. However, you will lose ALL of your progress! How does that sound?
* Oh, and also you get 5 pop-ups every second. So each minute, you will have 300 more pop-ups than before.
* And finally, your mouse cursor moves very slowly, so good luck closing the pop-ups!
* By the way, attempting to change the DPi also causes your computer to explode.
