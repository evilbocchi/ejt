You’re at the last sub-difficulty of {{Class3Difficulties|Catastrophic}} [[w:c:jtoh:Catastrophic|Catastrophic]], and the last tower difficulty alive. Welcome, {{USERNAME}}. You are now in the [[:Category:Sub-Difficulties|sub-difficulty]] known as '''Champion’s Road''', which is the difficulty form of the JToH tower [[w:c:jtoh:ToCR|Tower of Champion's Road]] (ToCR). It is located in [[:Category:Class 3|Mid Class 3]] as a sub difficulty and the normal difficulty {{Class3Difficulties|Horrific}} [[w:c:jtohs-hardest-towers:Horrific|Horrific]]. This difficulty contains gameplay & design similar to Tower of Champion's Road.

This difficulty is still [[:Category:Humanly Possible|humanly possible]], but extremely challenging, requiring great precision only the best of obbyists are capable of. Only true champions will surpass this, and the champion's road is (very likely)  for you.
==Icon Representation==
<tabber>Current=<center>[[File:Champion's Road.png|70x70px]]</center>
It contains the floor colors of ToCR, along with a small dark red line in the middle and a dark red circle in the center.
<small>(Made by Sanjay.)</small>
|-|
Old=<center>[[File:ToCR.png|80x80px]]</center>There is a teal background, with a yellow border, and the initials of the difficulties name in the middle. Just below the initials are the full difficulties name.
|-|
Older=<center>[[File:Champions road revamp.png|80x80px]]</center>
It is the same as the old icon, but the border is teal, and there are the colors of Tower of Champion’s Road, the crown is lower effort and so is the text.

Oldest=<center>[[File:Champion,s road.png|80x80px]]</center>
It is the same as the old icon, but more crudely drawn.
<small>(Made by haxour our (Heck-Hax).)</small>
|-|
Unused=<center>[[File:Unused CR.png|80x80px]]</center>
It is a teal background, with a black bit in the top left, top right and bottom left corners, along with a bunch of white scribbles, and a crudely drawn text saying ‘FR’, aswell as a crudely drawn crown. It is 100% the worst one.

Well, you’ve completed the canon difficulties of EToH. You are easily one of the best I’ve ever seen. You should take a break, as it’s good for you after completing something so mentally draining.
