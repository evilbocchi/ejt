==What is [[File: Square Simple (100).png|frameless|30x30px]] <span style="color:#ffa960;text">'''''Skip'''''</span>?==
[[File: Square Simple (100).png|frameless|30x30px]] <span style="color:#ffa960;text">'''''Skip'''''</span> is a High Class Negative difficulty that functions almost the same as [[File:Instantwin.png|frameless|30x30px]] [[Instant Win|<span style="color:#002eff;text">Instant Win</span>]] but way quicker. Sometimes since it's so fast, it may even lag your game or kick you out; you already skipped this difficulty. This difficulty also used to have a sub-difficulty called [[User blog:Loganboi2/Shortcut|Shortcut]], but it is now CDC exclusive.

This difficulty is absurdly easy, as it simply revolves around entering the portal and winning. Sometimes, you don't even need to enter the portal to win, since it's that easy.

==<span style="color:#ffa960;text">Icon Representation</span>==
{{IconRepresentation|image=[[File:Square Simple (100).png|50px]]|description=<span style="color:#ffa960;text">'''''Skip'''''</span>'s icon is just a black "<code>T_T</code>" face on a peach colored background. It's a pretty simple icon.|old_image=[[File:Skip.png|50px]]|old_description=This icon is similar to the current icon; peach color background with a "<code>T_T</code>" face. However, the face is hand-drawn and it is thicker than in the current icon. It also has a different sized canvas.|alt_image=[[File:Skipalt.png|50px]]|alt_description=This icon is basically the current icon but more detailed; the background is mostly peach on the center, but with different shades of peach and orange on the corners. Unlike the rest, this icon's "<code>T_T</code>" face has a smile, a lighter color, a black outline and it is also slightly rotated to the left.}}
