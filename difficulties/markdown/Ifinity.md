# Ifinity

Ifinity is a Peak Class Negative difficulty, existing just before Instant Win and after Restful. It is considered the first revived Class Negative difficulty and is notable for being virtually impossible to loseâ€”success is all but guaranteed. Ifinity is a playful take on the concept of difficulty, as it sits at the very bottom of the chart and requires no real challenge to complete. It is a unique entry that marks the transition to the official start of the chart.
