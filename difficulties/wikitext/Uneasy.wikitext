'''<span style="background:linear-gradient(#2459d6,#153582); -webkit-background-clip:text !important; -webkit-text-fill-color:transparent;">Uneasy</span>''' is a Class 3 sub-difficulty of [[w:c:ktoh:Extreme|<span style="color:#009DFF">Extreme</span>]]. This difficulty is insanely hard to beat, and most obbyists may not even reach this difficulty. Even professional obbyists may struggle with towers of this difficulty, with it being even harder than [[Madness]]. There is of course the occasional trap, and obstacles here may consist of difficulty among the qualities of [[w:c:jtoh:Tower of Confusion|<span style="color:0000FF">Tower of Confusion</span>]] except slightly buffed. '''As a Class 3 difficulty, it has a real tower''' (refer to below).

After beating [[w:c:ktoh:Extreme|<span style="color:#009DFF">Extreme</span>]]. You faced uneasy difficulty, This difficulty has some obstacles which are gonna make you feel uneasy to do the tower despite it being like that the tower itself is mostly short and half empty making the tower you're doing bearable to beat, Tower with this difficulty is hard to get consistent at due to its own very confusing and difficult obstacle to memorize.

Trying to beat this difficulty can cause you to go uneasy on it even if you can do it simply.
