Unreal is a difficulty represented by dark purple with a black square. It is above Horrific and below nil on the difficulty chart. Towers in this difficulty demand absurd skill, to the point of almost being considered luck. This difficulty is barely humanly possible, since you need an ungodly amount of skill and strategy to comfortably do it. The accuracy of towers in this difficulty is quite low as there are not many towers people can compare difficulties with, meaning some Unreal towers may be very overâ€“ or underrated. Above Mid Unreal (around STH difficulty) is generally considered to be humanly impossible on only 60 fps, so towers of a higher difficulty must be completed with FPS switching.
