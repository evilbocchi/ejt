==What is LOOP?==
'''LOOP''' is a difficulty that can be considered the most lengthy on the entire difficulty chart. Let me explain. There is a huge, actually, monolithic tower cross to every other [https://jtoh.fandom.com/wiki/Towers Tower], [https://jtohs-joke-towers.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Steeple Steeple], [https://jtohs-joke-towers.fandom.com/wiki/Category:NEAT NEAT], [https://jtohs-joke-towers.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Citadel Citadel], [https://jtohs-joke-towers.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Obelisk Obelisk], [https://jtohs-joke-towers.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Great_Citadel Great Citadel], [https://jtohs-joke-towers.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Great_Obelisk Great Obelisk], and even [https://jtoh.fandom.com/wiki/Tower_Rush Tower Rush] are literally much easier than itself and in existence. (This does not contain any fictional towers whatsoever.) This means gameplay in this difficulty can be hundreds of hours long. The total difficulty for all of these towers and tower types combined into one makes it a Class 9 difficulty. But wait, if all towers combined made this into a Class 9 difficulty, does that mean we can combine more Class 9 towers into this difficulty to make a class 15 one? 

==The LOOP Paradox==
If all towers below the difficulty were combined to make a mid Class 9 difficulty, this difficulty could include towers that are low-mid Class 9. (Below the difficulty, of course.) Because of this, it increases in difficulty, encompassing even more towers. This means that this difficulty is constantly multiplying in length and in difficulty. So that means that this difficulty is class 25, as it keeps being harder than it technically is, right? Well yes and no. The only thing stopping this difficulty from becoming the hardest thing in existence are the huge difficulty gaps in between the next towers. Eventually, difficulties get so hard that the gaps in between them are multiplied by the hundreds. Because of this, the hardest tower in Class 9 is far easier than the easiest ones in class 15. So, the difficulty cannot increase as there are no more towers to be added. However, if there were not as many huge gaps, this difficulty would swallow the entire universe with it. Luckily, it will always stay at Class 9. 

==Possible LOOP Records==
These are all the records LOOP could potentially break! Yes, it has many, and also explanations beside each for context. 

*Longest Difficulty.
**LOOP may have the title for the longest difficulty on the chart as you have to travel through hundreds of towers in its horrendous tower crossing section. That alone makes it hundreds of hours long.
***As mentioned in The LOOP Paradox section, this difficulty may be accidentally harder than itself. This means it can cover more towers up to [[The Final Difficulty.|TFD]]. That also makes the length of this tower about 25% longer, as more classes means a lot more towers.
*Hardest Difficulty.
**Had there not been as big of a gap between towers and difficulties in general, this would of been the hardest possible difficulty in existence as it would encompass everything possible. It’s a very good thing that you’ve been spared from this threat, though.
*Most Varied Difficulty. 
**With a lot of tower types comes tons of variation. The quality goes from low to amazing, obstacles go from instant to impossible, and even the height goes from monolithic to just a room. Because this difficulty encompasses most towers and tower types in the entire chart comfortably, that means there are a lot of factors changing. Basically like [[Randomization|Randomize]], but just with a little less factors.

==Icon Representation==

===Original Icon===
The old, aged icon is a spiral that goes down into the middle. At the center, it looks like a dot with a little bit of white still present. It is colored black, and is a little bit shaky, which is why you can see some imperfections. Behind the spiral is a white background. Other than that, the icon is quite minimal and simple. May or may not do a new icon, as this one looks pretty eh.

===Old Icon===
The old icon is actually a picture taken from google images. It is a better drawn spiral effect into the void, without the raggedy lines. The lines are still black, and the icon is still considered quite minimal compared to other over decorated icons.

=== Current Icon ===
TBA

==Towers In This Difficulty== 

*Every tower and tower type that is below this difficulty combined into here. Because of this, only one tower can exist, as each and every one has to fit the exact same criteria. The only thing that would change is if people made multiple LOOP towers. Then the order would be different as nobody has the same connected brain.
**Sadly, building a LOOP tower would be next to impossible. You have to gather up every tower in existence easier than this,
**Building [[Nenosi]] towers somehow would give a reward (if its diff is this)

==Obstacles In This Difficulty==

*Probably over half of the obstacles in existence, as a lot of towers are under Class 9. You’ll face hundreds of thousands of different varieties of obstacles along the way.
*Aside from that, you’ll face familiar towers you thought you beat. No, they’re coming back to haunt you.

==Continuing On From Loop==
Well I really doubt you did a tower in this difficulty as laziness is a strong emotion that pulls you in. But, move on to [[File:BRYANJR4474 DIFFICULTY.jpeg|frameless|40x40px]] [[Bryanjr4474]] next I guess. It’s another very difficult Class 9 difficulty that is a few times harder than this difficulty. Luckily for you, it is not nearly as repetitive as this huge difficulty, but it provides a large challenge. A test of skill, so you better be ready.
