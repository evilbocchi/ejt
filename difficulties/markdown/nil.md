# nil

nil is a difficulty below Error and above Unreal, represented by the color black with a gray outline. It was created specifically for the Citadel of Void, one of the hardest towers in Eternal Towers of Hell. Obstacles in nil are extremely unforgiving, requiring high precision and consistency, and are subject to changes in game physics.

nil was reserved for only the most challenging towers and is rarely seen due to its extreme difficulty.
