# Pinnacle

Pinnacle is the pinnacle of human buildability, representing the absolute limit of what can be constructed in Roblox. Obstacles at this level require heavy scripting and push the boundaries of the engine, making gameplay nearly impossible. Pinnacle marks the end of buildability, and any difficulty beyond this is not feasible, even for the most skilled players. It serves as a demonstration of the limits of the platform.
