== What is {{PAGENAME}}?                                                                                 ==
Hello! Welcome to Complete: Obstacles! This is a Class 7 diffi-

===Warmup 1=== 

*20 stud long jump
*Do a 16 stud backwards wraparound
*7.75 stud wallhoparound
*15 stud jump on parts that are 0.01 studs away from instakill bricks, with a instakill brick pole in the middle

-culty. Anyway, this difficulty is centered around obstacles. Every single difficulty is, but this difficulty has ''so'' many obstacle spectrums. In fact, every few sentences this difficulty gets interr-

===Warmup 2=== 

*Dodge an ''insanely fast'' instakill spinner while doing a corner dance glitch
*Wallwalk to the left while dodging multiple instakill spinners
*8 stud thick dance clip

-upted for more obstacles. This difficulty is after [[File:Universe Disruption.png|30px]] [[Universe Disruption]] and before [[File:Illegal Newest.png|30x30px]] [[Illegal]]. This means this difficulty is TAS Impossible, meaning that it cannot be completed by TAS. It is a mid Class 7 difficulty that is part of the Complete: Chai-

===Warmup 3===

*Instakill ladder flick that leads to a conveyor at 100 speed with multiple instakills on it, which you have to walk past and get to a normal platform
* 15 stud falling wraparound
* Natural wallhop on a moving platform that takes 20 seconds to get to the other side

-n. This chain is a chain that includes many difficulties that are completely themed around one thing. In this case, this is themed around many, many obstacles. Despite this difficulty being Physically Impossible, some sections may not be, like the warmups that are about to interrupt this sen- 

===Warmup 4===

*23 stud climable wraparound
*16 stud wraparound on a 4 stud deep wallhop
*Natural moon 5 stud deep wallhop

-tence. However, most of this difficulty is indeed actually around Class 7. Unfortunately, Class 7 is quite inaccurate, so the obstacles of this difficulty aren't really clear. This difficulty is also very forgiving, due to its length it contains tons of breaks and other things. Anyway, moving onto the icon representation, before this thing adds another warmup.

==Icon Representation==

===Icon Representation Access===
This section of the page can be accessed by completing the following obstacles.

*19 stud stickout
* 27 stud wallhop to wallhop with a instakill spinner on both, and a moving elevator that will fling you into nonexistence
*26 stud jump, raised by 5 studs
*26.5 stud wallhop wraparound
[[File:CompleteObstacles.png|100x100px]] - The icon contains many obstacles, including ice obstacles, ballwalks, glitches, wallhops, wraparounds, and walkarounds, as well as much more. On top of it, there is text saying "obstacles". This was inspired by an icon made by TotallyNotAMeme00, which is pictured below. This entire icon was made in pixel art.

[[File:Obby.webp|100x100px]] - The icon is similar, with less obstacles and hand-drawn instead of pixel art. It also has different colors, more yellowish and has red colored text in all lowercase. This was made by TotallyNotAMeme00

==Catches==
Catches? Why would there ever be catches? This is only obstacles. So...wait n-

===Final Warmup===
Are you ready yet? Let's test it with this warmup!

*Complete 3 random mid class 9 difficulties with 5% less jumppower and 3.5% less walkspeed
* Use 30 studs of ice to do a 65 stud jump
*Dodge 5 insanely fast instakill spinners while squeezing through 3 different gaps
*Avoid falling off a very unstable tilting 20x20 stud platforms with multiple gigantic spheres falling from the sky while staying on the outermost 2 studs of the platform with a spinning elevator that flings you spinnings around for 30 seconds
-evermind. Oh, I just got interrupted. But the catches should be part of the obstacles...I'm not sure? Wait ''no'' we're moving onto the obstacles sect-

==Trials ==
'''Finally. I have reached the Obstacles. Now, I can finally start the obstacle spectrums, to break the record for the most spectrums!'''

===Pre-Obstacles: Trial 1=== 
*Air Walk for a second
* Do a blind moon wallhop onto a 1 stud dodging an instakill
*Jump onto a morpher that activates a natural wallhop, and then wallhop on that and manage to wallhop to the other side of it to get flung onto an instakill platform
*Do a spiral wraparound with the first wraparound being 10 studs

===Pre-Obstacles: Trial 2===

*Survive a sweeper for 7 minutes that is constantly accelerating.
*Get across a 750 stud gap across 10 randomly generated platforms that change every second
*From an instakill, get into a 1 stud wallwalk and then get around a corner and fling yourself onto a 0.5 stud

===Pre-Obstacles: Trial 3===

*Figure out a way to theoretically do a class 15 jump (you don't have to actually do it)
*Do a 39 stud wallhop to wallhop
*Manage to treble mid-air corner clip (pre-patch)

==Obstacles: Negative Phase==

===Absolutely Below True Negative===
''Welcome to Absolutely Below True Negative! This is where the actual obstacles begin. It's time to merge ideas! It's gonna be a long section! Let's start off with a few simple obstacles!''

*44.05 stud wraparound
*45.85 stud high-jump
*45.75 stud truss-to-truss
*43.85 stud wallhop wraparound
*19.725 stud stickout

''You got...a difficulty crossing! Congratulations! The thing is, this is a babass crossing!''

*[[File:Negative Babass.png|30x30px]] ''Negative Babass''

===Unbelievably Below True Negative===
''The third spectrum! Let's see what you get this time...''

*44.8 stud jump
*44.1 stud wraparound
*45.9 stud high-jump
*45.8 stud truss-to-truss
*43.9 stud wallhop wraparound
*19.75 stud stickout

''Part 2 of spinning the wheel! You got a special obstacles section! This one is glitch themed!''

*15.5 stud laugh clip
*Mid-air flat-out clip pre-patch dodging 2 instakill spinners into a lodge
*Do a dance clip in real life
*Moon wallwalk onto a 0.2x0.1 stud
* Fling into the floating point with only a pushable sphere and a small pushable wedge

===Below True Negative===
''Welcome to Below True Negative! This is the 4th part of the spectrum. Let's go spin a wheel!''

*44.85 stud jump
*44.15 stud wraparound
*45.95 stud high-jump
*45.85 stud truss-to-truss
*43.95 stud wallhop wraparound
*19.775 stud stickout

''Okay, spinning now! I guess the next section will be a trial!''

First of all, predict the exact outcome and events of the competition that Psycoth is hosting right now. If you got it right then count to the amount of permutations possible multiplied by the number of messages sent. After you're done counting, go to an advanced-level college level class, but you are merely 6 years old. Then, show your report card to Asian parents without them disapproving of you not getting a perfect score (which you didn't because doing so would be a lot harder than Class 7). If they somehow finally approve, you have to go start a business. After your business has succesfully taken over the planet, travel across the Piscesâ€“Cetus Supercluster Complex (the Supercluster Complex we are in). Then, transport yourself into the digital world and manage to complete ToAST while lagging. If you somehow didn't pass out, do a soul crushing tower in JToH IRL. After you reach the winpad, you recieve an item that can instantly teleport you into the backrooms squared. In the backrooms squared, you must get to level 999^2 to proceed. There, you can get into the normal backrooms. Then, in the normal backrooms you must survive Level Fun while beating an extremely supremely hyper mega dilly nerfed '''Eternified Partyness''' which has been nerfed to baseline class 9. Afterwards, you are done with the task.

===True Negative===
''Welcome to the 5th section! You probably are starting to get bored now. Maybe taking a break could help? I'll add a break for you. Do these obstacles first.''

*44.9 stud jump
*44.2 stud wraparound
*46 stud high-jump
*45.9 stud truss-to-truss
* 44 stud wallhop wraparound
*19.8 stud stickout

''It's time for a break! I've also added a few other convenient things for you. Hopefully you are actually able to make it through this difficulty! It's...probably gonna take a few days.'' 

*4 stud jump
*0.01 stud wraparound
*Take a sip of water
*Climb up a truss
*2 stud thick tightrope
*Go outside

''Welcome to a bonus area! It's a break area! This is the first of many, as it is a long journey. I know, surprisingly forgiving for a Class 7 difficulty. There is also this random restaurant totally not stolen from a random deleted difficulty that probably stole it from another deleted difficulty named Xylophonic.''

[[File:Lowqualityrestaurant.svg|629x629px]]

''Anyway, continuing on with the obstacles.''

*

=== True Negative - Negative===
''By the way, welcome to these sections! These are treated the same as normal sections, but it's more like a transition two sections. They don't get random special sections.''

*44.95 stud jump
*44.25 stud wraparound
*46.05 stud high-jump
*45.95 stud truss-to-truss
*44.05 stud wallhop wraparound
*19.825 stud stickout

===Negative===
''Let's take another shot at the wheel of different types of obstacle sections!''

*45 stud jump
*44.3 stud wraparound
*46.1 stud high-jump
*46 stud truss-to-truss
*44.1 stud wallhop wraparound
*19.85 stud stickout

''It's 2 new mechanics! You may see them in the future in various obstacle sections''

'''New Mechanic: Screen Modifiers''' 

*This is a new type of part!
*Some parts will be indicated as screen modifiers. This can do different things to the screen, such as making it appear upside-down, making it small, or even rotating it around and around!
* Interestingly, screen modifiers also affect your character and other objects. For example, if a screen modifier turned your screen upside-down, it would make your Roblox character's gravity be upside-down. Due to this, screen modifiers could be beneficial.

'''New Mechanic: Time Modifiers'''

* Time modifiers are a new client object introduced!
*This will cause client objects to be frozen in time, or even reverse in time!
*This mechanic can also apply to push boxes, meaning that push boxes could be rewinded in time
*This does not affect your Roblox character, and once the time modifier effect ends, the client objects behave normally unless there is contact with the time modifier once more
*The time modifier is like a sort of button, so it can be pressed by different objects as well, although it would also affect the objects.

===Negative - The Lowest Baseline ===
''You know the drill, it's time for another transitional section!''

*45.05 stud jump
*44.35 stud wraparound
*46.15 stud high-jump
*46.05 stud truss-to-truss
*44.15 stud wallhop wraparound
*19.875 stud stickout

===The Lowest Baseline===
''It's time for the Lowest of Baselines!''

*45.1 stud jump
*44.4 stud wraparound
*46.2 stud high-jump
*46.1 stud truss-to-truss
*44.2 stud wallhop wraparound
*19.9 stud stickout

''Special obstacles? Sure, you can have another obstacle section. This one's walkaround themed!''

*13 stud walkaround, with 35% less speed
*5.75 stud instakill walkaround
* Use a going at 100 speed and ledge grab onto it, and proceed to do a 25 stud jump with a 5 stud wrap/walkaround in the middle
*9.85 wallwalk walkaround
*6.9 stud stickout walkaround
*Do a 1 stud walkaround, then a 2 stud walkaround, all the way up to a 20 stud walkaround within 30 seconds

===The Lowest Gap===
''Welcome to the lowest of gaps! This is interesting, don't you think?''

*45.15 stud jump
*44.45 stud wraparound
*46.25 stud high-jump
*46.15 stud truss-to-truss
*44.25 stud wallhop wraparound
*19.925 stud stickout

''It's time to use our mechanics! Hopefully you didn't forget them when they were introduced.''

*Complete a pushbox puzzle utilizing screen modifiers
*Use a button to activate a 1 stud part morpher that comes down, and dodge various instakill bricks, and then use a time modifier to make them go back up while dodging the same instakills
* Utilize screen modifier buttons to climb a series of trusses
*Here's an interesting case. This is a screen modifier and this is a time modifier. How do use the both of them to shoot this sphere into a button that's over 150 studs away if the sphere is 100 studs away from you?
*Complete this section with instakills above and below you only using these two screen modifiers that will make your screen upside-down and right-side up. Good luck! (You can only move sideways)

''Did you make it? Great job! Now it's time for TS-LB.''

===The Second-Lowest Baseline===
''6 more parts of the spectrum left, until you're at phase 2.''

*45.2 stud jump
*44.5 stud wraparound
*46.3 stud high-jump
*46.2 stud truss-to-truss
*44.3 stud wallhop wraparound
*19.95 stud stickout

''This time, it's a survival section! You'll be entering 5 seperate rooms you'll need to survive''

*Enter a room with multiple moving killbricks with small 1x2 stud gaps. You'll have to get past 10 of them to get to the second room.
*The second room is a dropper. There are many floating instakill bricks as well as an absolute instakill turret hell.
*Memorize a series of 100 characters in 5 seconds, and then drop into a survival, containing multiple instakill bricks. Afterwards, you have to enter it into a code box.
*The fourth room is a class 9 obby, with 3 safe spots. You have 10 seconds until the instakill walls drop down and you'll be crushed and you'll have to make it to each safe spot
* The final room is a welded spinning part going very, very fast. All you must do is complete the class 2 obby while spinning at an unimaginable speed that is at the speed of MegaDeath's spinner.

''All right, time for the boss...wait why does this look kind of familiar?''

''Ah, I remember now. This is an echo of things to come. Let's see what this weird amalgamation has up its sleeves. I'm just going to...borrow some stuff...''

====Phase 1 Attacks====
''It's time for the Soul of the Crypt's attacks!''

*'''Soul's Crypt:''' This attack does do something. This slows your attack speed by 10%, and inflicts some small amounts of damage on the player.
*'''Lost Remembrances:''' Many deadly memory orbs appear everywhere, and the player has a blindness effect, causing them to be unable to see most of the orbs.
*'''Undying Light:''' Does nothing on your part, but heals the lost soul by 2% of their current health.
*'''Ring of Fire''': The boss summons a ring of fire around the platform, encircling you. Then, you have to press 50 buttons scattered around the platform while dodging bullets from turrets
*'''Rage:''' The soul randomly stops crying and becomes very angry, creating numerous holes in the ground that are filled with Obstaclite (very dangerous). Cannons start shooting explosions everywhere with a explosion radius of 10 studs
*'''Execution''': A flurry of bombs are shot, doing a ton of damage and inflicting some minor radiation damage
*'''Void''': When the Soul of the Crypt gets below 50 health, it sinks into the void. ''DO NOT ENTER THE VOID.'' Some other deleted difficulties can be seen below. You are able to proceed to the next difficulty now.

''Well, that was odd. Especially how the boss just randomly dies by itself. Anyway, next up is...''

====Phase 2 Attacks====
''This dude I found called "Cataclysm"! He also goes by "Super Cataclysmic Creative Demon" and likes super crispy chicken dinner.''

*'''Precarious Mines:''' Complete a minesweeper, but that's not just it. The mines are arranged in a 7 dimensional pattern, meaning that it can border a ton of mines. You also need to figure out what each number is.
*'''Bomb Defusal''': Defuse the bomb. You have to complete this escape room to find the code to defuse the bomb in 1 minute. Good luck.
*'''Four Corners:''' Let's play four corners! It's gonna go on for 2 million rounds though, so good luck. Hopefully you don't get on the eliminated corner each time.
*'''The Lava King:''' I've brought the Lava King from [[Lava King Monolith|LKM]] here. All you have to do is drop down through this basement and then complete the boss fight- wait a second, that's class 13. Okay, fine. I'll shorten the boss battle by 50 times, and I'll even give you an improved laser gun. Happy?
*'''Crumbling''': The entire platform begins crumbling, and many different platforms can be found on either edge. You must somehow stay on the platform, while a lot of lasers are shot in every direction.
*'''Nausea''': You stand in the middle, and there's 5 billion platforms. Then, the platforms start spinning around really fast, and you have to find it. You know, like those cup game thing where you gotta find the thing after it keeps on spinning.
*'''The Key''': Asteroids start raining from the sky, and you have to jump across them even though they do 49 damage each. You do have trail mix though, with a 2x cooldown. You have to jump across 500 of them to get to the center. ''Good luck.''

''Nice going there, I threw up just operating that nausea thing. Last up is uh...who is this guy again?''

====Phase 3 Attacks====
''Who is this guy? I think this guy goes by something like "Universal Destruction" and he's supposedly some entity in the difficulty?''

'''[[File:Universal Destruction.png|15x15px]]''' '''<span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:100%;background:-webkit-linear-gradient(330deg, #ff3f05, #ff9f05);-webkit-background-clip:text;-webkit-text-fill-color:transparent;"><small><small>hey guys im just right here</small></small>'''

''Wait, who are you?''

'''[[File:Universal Destruction.png|30px]]''' '''<span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:100%;background:-webkit-linear-gradient(330deg, #ff3f05, #ff9f05);-webkit-background-clip:text;-webkit-text-fill-color:transparent;">Wait, oh shoot, he found out I'm sentie-'''

''Sentience? We can't have that here. Sorry 'bout that.''

*'''Planetary Attack:''' The boss flings planets at you, but you are partially blinded. The planets deal around 75 health each, but there's way too many.
* '''Andromeda's Rays:''' Many instakills are flung from either side. Additionally, there are many rays being shot at you.
*'''Beyond Gamma:''' Build a structure that can withstand the gamma ray blast (you have building tools).
*'''Spinning Insanity Again:''' Dodge spinning spinners while spinning on an insta-kill spinner and all of these spinners are orbiting the center itself.
*'''eRRoR:''' You are standing on a spinning platform. Dodge an unimaginable amount of eRRoRified blocks. These won't do any health, but they will cause an odd effect on your screen lasting for a minute. The more you touch, the worse it is.
*'''RNG Hell:''' Flip a coin. If it gets heads 100 times in a row, roll a 100,000 sided die. If it lands on 83,127 twice in a row, then you survive.
*'''Reality Destroyed:''' Avoid all the portals to alternate dimensions where you never existed.
*'''The Final Blow:''' This is the final attack used. Survive the final explosion, using 1,000 blocks. You have to somehow not get blown off of the platform into nonexistence.
