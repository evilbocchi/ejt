# Literal

Literal is a difficulty represented by the color Earth Blue (RGB 32, 58, 86). It is used for towers that are harder than Error but easier than WHY. Literal defines towers with obstacles that are almost impossible to verify normally and must be proven physically possible using tool assistance.

Literal serves as a rigorous test of the upper limits of possibility, demanding significant time and a deep understanding of obby mechanics. The icon has gone through several redesigns, with the current version featuring a simple blue background. Literal was added to balance the difficulty chart and provide a proper challenge between Error and WHY.
