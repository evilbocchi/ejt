==What is <span style="background:linear-gradient(120deg,#04fe94,#06fe98); -webkit-background-clip:text !important; -webkit-text-fill-color:transparent;">'''Jesus Ballin'''</span>?                  ==
[[File:Jes.png|frameless|30x30px]] <span style="background:linear-gradient(120deg,#04fe94,#06fe98); -webkit-background-clip:text !important; -webkit-text-fill-color:transparent;">'''Jesus Ballin'''</span> is one of the hardest known difficulties imaginable, Jesus is ballin'. Who would dare to confront him into a challenge? Jesus Ballin' is a Low Class 7 Difficulty between [[File:ROOR HELL new.png|frameless|30x30px]] [[RoorHELL]] and [[File:El Vacio Sqaure.png|frameless|30x30px]] [[El Vacio]], and also has two sub-difficulties, [[File:HyperViolent New.png|frameless|30x30px]] [[HyperViolent]] and  [[File:Enfarted.gif|30x30px]] [[Enclosed]]. The icon on the background is represented by a light-ish green color similar to {{Class1Difficulties|Easy}} [[w:c:ktoh:Easy|<span style="color:#00FF00">Easy</span>]]. Though easily huh? Comparable to a greener {{Class3Difficulties|Terrifying}} [[w:c:ktoh:Terrifying|<span style="color:#00EBFF">Terrifying</span>]] with a transparent picture of [[Jesus Christ|Jesus]] playing with a Basketball because, '''Yes'''. As of now, there's not much known about this difficulty since it's pretty mysterious... The difficulty's image USED to have a different Jesus but more visible. However, it has been changed for unknown reasons (Unspecified Reasons). Jesus will be ballin' until you finish his Difficulty, He won't stop, He will never stop! (he do be ballin) 

<span style="background:linear-gradient(120deg,#04fe94,#06fe98); -webkit-background-clip:text !important; -webkit-text-fill-color:transparent;">'''Jesus Ballin'''</span> will consist of TAS being Impossible, Y'know jumps are almost impossible at this point, right? It could be possible but with a very highly chance to beat it, well this is now the time the Judge will Judge YOU if you are trustworthy managing to pass through him while he's ballin!

==Icon Representation==
{{IconRepresentation|difficulty=Jesus Ballin|image=[[File:Jes.png|50px]]|old_image=[[File:JesusBallin.png|50px]]|description=The current icon is simply Jesus Ballin with a light greenish background.

He is also Ballin' with a basketball, ready to shoot.|alt_description=This icon by Jpjusto is the same Jesus from the current icon with a lighter greenish background with Him being more visible. He is also Ballin' with a basketball.}}

== ''Now what, where should I head next?''==
Wow! There is no WAY you just beat Jesus Ballin'... right? You're not a HUMAN and you're not a god obbyist. I'm indeed 100% sure that you must have Jesus himself by your side. I'm shocked that you have managed to surpass such a monstrous difficulty! But now... you must continue your journey my friend. Go ahead to the next difficulty which is [[File:El Vacio Sqaure.png|frameless|30x30px]] [[El Vacio]]. I wish you the best of luck, do not give up partner!
