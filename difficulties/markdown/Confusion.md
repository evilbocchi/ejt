# Confusion

Confusion is a Class difficulty that resides after and before redacted difficulties, making it an Unbuildable difficulty. It is impossible to attempt or replicate its obstacles within Roblox, as the engine cannot handle the required complexity. The only conceivable way to complete it would be through exploits, but even that is unlikely. The difficulty is named Confusion due to its disorienting and indecipherable nature, both in obstacles and in the experience it provides. It is part of the "Confusion Chain" and is intentionally unbuildable and enigmatic.
