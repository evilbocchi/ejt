# Gravel

Gravel is a peak Class 1 sub-difficulty of Effortlessless, preceding Effortless and White Gem in the Excavation Chain. It is one of the easiest difficulties with actual obstacles and can be beaten by most Roblox obbyists. Gravel is welcoming to beginners, featuring forgiving towers filled with safety nets and simple jumps that require little effort.

This difficulty is common in many generic obby games and is designed to help new players build confidence. The obstacles are only slightly harder than those in Effortlessless, making Gravel a gentle introduction to more challenging gameplay.
