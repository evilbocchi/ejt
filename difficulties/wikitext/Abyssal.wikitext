==What is <span style="background:linear-gradient(45deg,white, #49fd83, white); -webkit-background-clip:text !important; -webkit-text-fill-color:transparent;">'''Abyssal'''?</span> ==
<span style="background:linear-gradient(45deg,white, #49fd83, white); -webkit-background-clip:text !important; -webkit-text-fill-color:transparent;">'''Abyssal'''</span> is the third Class 8 difficulty and the final regular difficulty. This is the final barrier before Reality and Virtual Reality difficulties collide. This is the final infinity before everything starts over. This difficulty requires insane tricks and glitches to be able to pass.

But this is not the end. Even though this is already extremely hard, the next difficulties are going to be even harder. There are no more regular obstacles after this. Only virtually & obviously impossible ones.

This difficulty has a barrier of obstacles so impossible that [[MegaDeath]] is [[Win]] compared to this difficulty of true impossibility. 

== Icon Representation ==
This difficulty is represented by a white background with a very deep fried XD, representing the laughable impossibility obbies of this difficulty contain.

==Towers with <span style="background:linear-gradient(45deg,white, #49fd83, white); -webkit-background-clip:text !important; -webkit-text-fill-color:transparent;">'''Abyssal'''</span> Difficulty ==

== Trivia==

*At one point in time, this difficulty was the hardest difficulty on the chart.
**Now, it's one of the simplest.
*<s>''If we count it 1 by 1, difficulties only, then '''Abyssal''' is the 200th difficulty on the chart.''</s>

==Continuing from This Point ==
Wow, congrats on beating this. Head to your 3rd legendary difficulty, [[Dilly Impossible]].
