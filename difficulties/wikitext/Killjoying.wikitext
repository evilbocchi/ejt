== What is Killjoying? ==
'''Killjoying''' is a low-mid Class 5 humanly impossible difficulty of [[CALAMITY]]. Obstacles in here are so hard that without TAS, this difficulty is impossible.. This difficulty is harder than [[Neutralize]], This is the XD chain, or super-buffed variant of [[w:c:jtoh:Unreal|Unreal]], and is the fourth hardest difficulty in the XD chain.

== XD Chain Navigation ==
Killjoying is also in the XD chain. This chain is just a buffed version of some difficulties from JToH. Killjoying is represented as a buffed version of Unreal. The icon is the old Unreal icon, and there is also an alternative, new icon based off the new Unreal icon.

Difficulties in the XD chain include:

==Trivia ==

*''Killjoying'' was inspired by Tower of Killjoys
*This difficulty was inspired by [[File:NewestCalamity.png|30x30px]] [[CALAMITY]].
*This is the final of the XD Chain, after [[File:ContradictionModern.png|30x30px]] [[Contradiction|Contradition]] was deleted.

== Continuing From This Point==
You should definitely take a break if you have beaten this. Difficulties beyond this are very unforgiving, so I suggest you stop beating more or there will be consequences. But if you want to continue so badly, just go straight to [[File:UnimaginableDifficulty.webp|30px]] [[w:c:jtohs-hardest-towers:Unimaginable|Unimaginable]].
