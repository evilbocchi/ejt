It is the third hardest difficulty of the Universal Difficulty Chart.

{{Class7Difficulties|Ultimate}} <span style="font-weight;font-size:100%;background:-webkit-linear-gradient(red, maroon);-webkit-background-clip:text;-webkit-text-fill-color:transparent;">'''Ultimate'''</span> represents the assumed limit of difficulty, meaning it consists of the hardest jumps that we believe to be possible, not that it can ever be officially verified by human or technology. 

An example of an Ultimate difficulty tower would be, if you took Chaotic Tower and buffed every floor to what you believe to be the hardest possible difficulty, and then extended the tower to some degree.

Then there a letter of the Greek alphabet centered in the middle of the icon. The letter is "Psi" ψ, highlighted in red.

==Other Information==
*<span style="font-weight;font-size:100%;background:-webkit-linear-gradient(red, maroon);-webkit-background-clip:text;-webkit-text-fill-color:transparent;">Ultimate</span> was the second difficulty of the ''''<nowiki/>'''True Hardest difficulties to be made, the first was [[Autism]].
*<span style="font-weight;font-size:100%;background:-webkit-linear-gradient(red, maroon);-webkit-background-clip:text;-webkit-text-fill-color:transparent;">Ultimate</span> is one of the final difficulties in YourNuglyguy's Difficulty Chart.
*Originally, Ultimate's definition was pretty much identical to Supreme, and was placed after [[w:c:jtohs-hardest-towers:Malicious|Malicious]] difficulty. 
**"''... Ultimate Difficulty is, like what you said, “99.9999999999999999 etc% of being impossible,” Malicious is the end of all difficulties, but ultimate difficulty, is the END of the end of all difficulties, Ultimate difficulty represents the absolute maximum, there is no “low ultimate difficulty” or “high Ultimate difficulty,” describe it as a border, Ultimate difficulty is slightly over borderline malicious, if borderline malicious floors are possible, then so are difficulties above it.''

==Continuing Past This Point...==
Congratulations on completing the ultimate peak of difficulty, or is that what you believed? Yes, this is ultimately difficult but there are still several levels of difficulty that lie ahead. You are still nowhere near the end of the chart. It is time to move forward and onto {{Class7Difficulties|System Error}} [[System Error|<span style="font-weight;font-size:100%;background:-webkit-linear-gradient(red, maroon);-webkit-background-clip:text;-webkit-text-fill-color:transparent;">System Error</span>]], but beware; for nearly every jump from now on will require perfect alignment, precision and timing. ''There is zero room for error.''
