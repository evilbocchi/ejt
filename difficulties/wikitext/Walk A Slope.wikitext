==Introduction - Walk A Slope==
Slopes are used for everything from obbies to roofs for buildings to escalators. But in this difficulty, you will be learning about walking through different types of slopes, from steep to wide. Slopes look like a rotated (often by 45 degrees) part that you can walk on, and thus you are able to gain speed by walking down a slope (only in real life) because of your momentum. You may also learn to do harder variants of obstacles you have previously done (like climbing a truss or walking), but the next difficulty will challenge you to use your skills on these new obstacles you have learned through this class. WAS is a Class 1 difficulty consisting of a slope-walk.                                                                          

==Icon Representation - Walk A Slope==
The icon consists of a top-left grey slope representing the floor color/background and a bottom-right red slope which is the one you walk on. There's text saying "Walk A Slope" in the bottom-left. The slopes are 45 degrees.

== Trivia ==

* For a long time, this difficulty was placed after Climb a Truss on the difficulty chart, even though when it was originally made it was placed before. The majority of difficulty chart games with this difficulty still have it placed after CAT, against the creators wishes.

==Continuing on==
Well, that was a useful but easy skill to learn, but [[File:JumplessDifficulty.webp|25px]] [[Jumpless]] may still be easy for you because it is just a review of all of the motionful skills you have learned since [[File:Press a Key.png|25px]] [[Press a Key]]. So then, good luck on your journey!
