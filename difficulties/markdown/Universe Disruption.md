# Universe Disruption

Universe Disruption is a Class 7 difficulty, and is the first of three challenges to prepare you to face the terminus of the official chart, MegaDeath. It is located after El Vacio and before Illegal (or Complete: Obstacles as sub-difficulty). The difficulty is unfeasible even while using TAS and boost items, meaning stuff like exploits is a must to have an opportunity at moving forward.

Oh no, what did you do? You overloaded the universe WAY too much, and now thereâ€™s a massive malfunction with the system! You need to fix it by traversing through impossible obstacles to overload the system until it activates its natural safeguard and returns to safe levels.
