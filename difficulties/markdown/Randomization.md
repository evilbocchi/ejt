# Randomization

Randomization is an unclassified "difficulty" that functions more as a mode or challenge due to its entirely randomized nature. Each attempt at a tower with this difficulty results in a different experience, as the difficulty level changes every time you die. The challenge is unpredictable, and success relies heavily on luck. Randomization is for those seeking a unique and variable challenge, where the only constant is change.
