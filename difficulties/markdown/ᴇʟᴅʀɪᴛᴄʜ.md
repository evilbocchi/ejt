ᴇʟᴅʀɪᴛᴄʜ is a difficulty before Monstrous, but succeeding the difficulty Mischievous. To beat this difficulty you must need skills that no human has. You also must complete insanely difficult jumps, and tight areas that you must climb out of. The difficulty is designed to be difficult and hard to follow, as sometimes the confusing mechanics and unknown paths can make it hard to find the right thing to do. Being the last difficulty in Mid class 5 on the Main Difficulty chart, this difficulty is classic and serves a nostalgic service in the chart.
