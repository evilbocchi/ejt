== What is The Death Chain? ==
The Death Chain is a chain that contains all difficulties that follow MegaDeath. You can see that all Death Chain difficulties are somehow related by looking at their names, icons, etc. They're usually stupidly impossible, as most of them are Class 8, with two being in Class 9. Good luck beating all Death Chain difficulties if that's on your bucket list. 

Amazingly, two Death Chain difficulties have made it onto the popular pages. Those being: [[PentaDeath]] and [[MegaDeath]]. These pages are very well written, as with every other popular page. Both difficulties are very well known, and [[MegaDeath]] is a fabled difficulty unlike its copies.

All of the Death Chain difficulties can be found below, or in the "All Items" sector. Happy reading, but also dying.
