==What is '''[[Critical]]'''?==
'''[[Critical]]''' is a class 5 difficulty sandwiched between [[File:Simply Beyond.jpg|30px|link=Simply Beyond]] [[Simply Beyond]] and [[File:Winter New.png|30px|link=Winter]] [[Winter]]. Attempting this difficulty is highly unrecommended, as it can be very difficult to even understand obstacles, and it's several orders of magnitude harder to complete such obstacles legitimately.

Obstacles of this difficulty are usually several smaller obstacles pieced together with no room in-between to take a break at, plus several frame perfects at framerates higher than preset framerates offered by standard Roblox FPS unlockers, with no-cap options being your only chance plus a very high-end device. However, with TAS, you could potentially render each frame with a small time increment at a very slowed-down pace, given that your TAS actually has these tools for high framerate gameplay.
