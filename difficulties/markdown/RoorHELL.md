# RoorHELL

RoorHELL is a Class 7 sub-difficulty and one of the first Physically Impossible challenges. It succeeds RoorXD and is marked by obstacles that require extreme luck and skill, far beyond human or even TAS capabilities. The difficulty is characterized by RNG jumps with very low success rates, and is generally only possible for highly skilled AI or through exploiting. RoorHELL marks the beginning of the Physically Impossible tier, pushing the boundaries of what can be achieved in obby gameplay.
