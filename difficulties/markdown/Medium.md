Medium is a difficulty in EToH that is represented by a yellow trapezoid. Obstacles at this level are more challenging and sometimes harder forms of obstacles seen in the Easy difficulty. There are slightly longer jumps, more wraps (often 2-3 studs), and generally tougher obstacles. One-stud platforms may start appearing in towers of this difficulty. Towers in this difficulty can be passed fairly easily by an average EToH player.
