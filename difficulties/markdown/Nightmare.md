# Nightmare

Nightmare is a Low Class 4 difficulty, represented by a black-grey-black gradient. It is humanly impossible to beat and is recommended only for those using tool-assisted speedruns or similar aids. Nightmare is a successor to nil and a predecessor to Error, featuring extremely luck-based and precise obstacles.

Completing even a single floor of a Nightmare difficulty tower is a significant achievement, as the obstacles require prodigious skill and luck.
