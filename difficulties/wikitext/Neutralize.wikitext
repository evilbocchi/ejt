{{BetterQuote|text=Good luck traveler, as to do this legitimately, you'll need a wide knowledge of different skills such as wraparounds, trusses, and many, many glitches.

That's truly impressive. How did you complete a Humanly Impossible difficulty, that would even take ages to make a TAS out of it? Well, I don't know why it was done, but it's okay. Go to [[File:Killjoying.jpg|31x31px]] [[Killjoying]], as it is the next sub difficulty and the final difficulty in this chain. Good luck, since at this point, you'll definitely need it.<br />{{DifficultiesNavbox}}
