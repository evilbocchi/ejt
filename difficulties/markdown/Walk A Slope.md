Slopes are used for everything from obbies to roofs for buildings to escalators. But in this difficulty, you will be learning about walking through different types of slopes, from steep to wide. Slopes look like a rotated (often by 45 degrees) part that you can walk on, and thus you are able to gain speed by walking down a slope (only in real life) because of your momentum. You may also learn to do harder variants of obstacles you have previously done (like climbing a truss or walking), but the next difficulty will challenge you to use your skills on these new obstacles you have learned through this class. Walk A Slope is a Class 1 difficulty consisting of a slope-walk.
