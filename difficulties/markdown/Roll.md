# Roll

Roll is a variation of the Unlosable difficulty in Class 0. Instead of conveyors, players are placed inside a hollow ball that rolls down a slope or slide, automatically carrying them to the winpad. The challenge is minimal, as the design ensures near-impossibility of failure. Roll is meant to be completed quickly and effortlessly, providing a fun and automatic experience before moving on to more challenging difficulties.
