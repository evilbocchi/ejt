# Effortless

Effortless was the previous easiest difficulty in EToH before its deletion. It was represented with a darker green color than Easy. Towers in this difficulty contained extremely simplistic and basic obstacles, such as the Tower of Slight Unhappiness. Effortless was removed from the game in June 2019 for being too easy, and its towers were either revamped or removed entirely.
