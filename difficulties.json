This is the first difficulty with actual obstacles in it, just imagine any obstacle that could be beaten by anybody. \nIt is not a joke like most of the other lower difficulties, but rather now can be played by beginners who have little to no experience with obbies. You won't struggle here, and you will easily get to the next difficulty. This is like a \"tutorial\", because there are now new jumps instead of simply holding keys. \nYou're likely going to win, most people do not find this as a challenge. This is the difficulty a newbie should start at if they're experienced at Roblox. Difficulties placed lower than this may be a good training tool for AI."

There cannot be a Low-Mid-High range within Supreme. There can only be \"Supreme\" as it is the true, supreme limit to possible difficulty. The slightest buff will make this physically impossible.\nFurther Description\nHowever, we face an issue with this definition. Given a tower of ten floors is placed within Supreme; the tower can be extended \u2013 a tower of eleven floors of Supreme difficulty. This is a buff; the new tower is intrinsically harder than the previous. Therefore the ten-floor version was not the limit of difficulty, so it cannot be considered Supreme.\nTo fix this issue, Supreme can be fully defined as \"the limit of difficulty within a domain\".

Obstacles of this difficulty must balance on the fine line of being the absolute most difficult while still being non-physically impossible. It is tough to keep such balance, meaning most portrayals of this difficulty are inaccurate.\nIcon Representation\nThe borderless icon is a linear gradient from pink (bottom) to blue (top). Due to this, the colors blend together and create some purple in the middle, with there being less pink than blue. \nThe new icon is also a linear gradient; but with a thick border that follows the same pink-to-blue gradient as the background, the border however is brighter and more saturated, in contrast to the darker, nearly-black gradient center.

        "description": " Enigmatic is a normal difficulty which was transferred from the JCC Wiki to the JJT Wiki. Unlike the original, which is in Low Rank 3, this difficulty is the entry point of Class 14, being in the Baseline spectrum of the class. However, it used to be in Peripheral Class 15. \nIt is currently a successor to Omniscient, and a predecessor to Vrery hawrfd rdifficutl!!. During its time in the End of the Official Chart, it was a predecessor of the difficulty-ized 52! phenomenon, known as 52!, and was a successor to True Obama Prism. Also, during its time in Class 14 it was a successor to The Middleline, and a predecessor to Peril.\nThe ludicrous sizes of these obstacles nullify all uses of boost items, even blessed coil. You will never be able to beat this difficulty, or create towers in this difficulty, due to how high up this difficulty is."

        "description": " HELLWRATH is a Class 9 difficulty, coming after Free-smiley.de, and before LOOP. It also has a sub-difficulty called Hellacious. It uses similar logic to Errorisation, but it's way harder than it. It requires godlike obby skill, exploiting skill, and mechanical skill, but even with those abilities, you'll never get close to beating even the easiest obstacles of this, because as you heard already - it's a Class 9 difficulty. It's simply way too hard to beat due to it's obstacles and what the difficulty does itself. \nThe winpad is invisible, CanCollide false, and is only 0.05x0.05x0.05 studs in size, and the position cannot be found with scripts, as it will ban you. The position of the winpad is randomized aswell, and can be from 1k studs to 10m studs away from the spawn. You should've stayed in the lower classes, but now you will see your fate. "

        "description": "LOOP is a difficulty that can be considered the most lengthy on the entire difficulty chart. Let me explain. There is a huge, actually, monolithic tower cross to every other Tower, Steeple, NEAT, Citadel, Obelisk, Great Citadel, Great Obelisk, and even Tower Rush are literally much easier than itself and in existence. (This does not contain any fictional towers whatsoever.) This means gameplay in this difficulty can be hundreds of hours long. The total difficulty for all of these towers and tower types combined into one makes it a Class 9 difficulty. But wait, if all towers combined made this into a Class 9 difficulty, does that mean we can combine more Class 9 towers into this difficulty to make a class 15 one? "

It can be classified as a humanly, physically, and TAS impossible difficulty, so prepare yourself.\nBut wait...\nIt has just a few catches that makes this as hard as it is. You see, the obstacles themselves aren't that hard (at least for a Class 10 obbyist like you), but the catches will make it hundreds of times more difficult. For example, one of the obstacles could be a 13 stud wrap. Easy, right? However, a catch could be \"You have eternal blindness\", which is why this is a Class 10 difficulty."

        "description": " Viratical is a devilish difficulty, and is the penultimate difficulty of The End of the Official Chart (C10). It is in High Class 10, and is located succeeding Oh Noez!, and preceding Pinnacle. You may be on the last difficulty before you face the End of The Main Chart, but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019ll be easy. This difficulty stretches the ultimate border between fiction and non-fiction, completely nullifying any type of TAS, or hacks, and your roblox character will be decimated by a spinner at the speed of sound, before you even realize.\nOverall, you most likely will never end up beating this, as there\u2019s a limit of capabilities in everything."

It does not make sense, since The Middleline is the set in stone, end. This isnt the beginning OR end of anything. Its nowhere. \nHowever, this cant be unclassified since it has obstacles that are the SAME difficulty dependent on its point between these 2 difficulties. This wouldn't happen without The Aleph Sequence (baseline Class 11, ranging from Supreme-Null to Aleph) which Missing is not a part of.\nYou may be scratching your head, questioning: \u201cjust use the main chart, wacko.\u201d Well, that's the big picture. Looking behind it, you see that this was designed to be EASIER than the main chart. we cant do this. So do we place this inbetween Vigorous and The Middleline? Well, no. This is harder than both, but easier than the Aleph Sequence. \nOverall: This cant be determined. Its not the end. Not the beginning. Not anything. This cant be unclassified, too. "
