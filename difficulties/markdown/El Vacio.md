El Vacio is Spanish for THE VOID. The original icon resembled an SMG4 poorly edited picture that was made creepier. (It was originally going to be black with the SCP-087 face and XD on it, which would have been even more nightmarish.) The current icon is not as creepy as RoorHELL, D-I-E, or Nonexistent. Obbies with this difficulty should be much harder than Jesus Ballin' and are ultimately impossible. Seriously, do not even think about beating this difficulty. Every obstacle in this difficulty is very rare and extremely hard to maneuver. As of now, this difficulty is buffed and is a lot harder than Jesus Ballin', maybe even harder than Universe Disruption or Aleph-cow, and very rarely Megadeath, depending on how you design your obstacle. Attempting an obstacle of this difficulty will cause imminent death.
