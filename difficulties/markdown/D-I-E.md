# D-I-E

D-I-E is a Class 6 difficulty that comes after Nonexistent and before Absolutism (or Gar-Extreme in chains). It marks the end of the Road of Pseudo-Difficulties and is classified as humanly impossible. This difficulty is an immense challenge, featuring frame-perfect glitches and obstacles that can frustrate even the best Low Class 6 obbyists. Beating D-I-E is a significant achievement, as it requires exceptional skill and persistence.
