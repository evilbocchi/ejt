This is due to it going up into the tens of billions of studs, which is SOMEHOW still buildable, and a tower doesn’t necessarily have to include more than one jump, so this is still buildable.

Jumps in this difficulty require heavy scripting, due to the obstacles being the absolute maximum of Roblox’s rendering engine. Any jumps with a higher stud count than <span style="background:linear-gradient(yellow,orange); -webkit-background-clip:text !important; -webkit-text-fill-color:transparent;"><span style="text-shadow: darkorange 0px 0.5px 6px;">'''Pinnacle'''</span></span>’s peak phase are still buildable, but however start glitching out and start to become invisible, as well as the area becoming dark simply because the lighting engine can’t keep up either.

Think of it like Minecraft Bedrock Edition, there is a certain point at which you encounter the stripe lands. Terrain generation becomes extremely glitchy, camera movement becomes nigh impossible, and you must use an elytra and creative mode to continue moving forward.

Keep in mind you should also take this as solely a demonstration, as <span style="background:linear-gradient(yellow,orange); -webkit-background-clip:text !important; -webkit-text-fill-color:transparent;"><span style="text-shadow: darkorange 0px 0.5px 6px;">'''Pinnacle'''</span></span> is not feasible in any way, even for an adept obbyist, like you. The creator could not find a proper adjacency of such a difficulty, due to C14 being too unbalanced, so this is the best he could do.

That might be why you think this isn’t the buildable limit, even though it is. Also, [[File:Stardark.png|25px|link=Stardark]] [[File:StardarkText.png|link=Stardark|60px]],is NOT useless now, just solely repurposed for non-Roblox studio tower buildability limits.

In short, this is the end of buildability, and is solely for show.
==Icon Representation==
<span style="background:linear-gradient(yellow,orange); -webkit-background-clip:text !important; -webkit-text-fill-color:transparent;"><span style="text-shadow: darkorange 0px 0.5px 6px;">'''Pinnacle'''</span></span>’s icon is represented by a yellow to dark yellow gradient, with three white exclamation marks, with a grey border around them. There are 2 DX and XD emoticons, a :) emoticon, a >:( emoticon, a ??. emoticon, a :] emoticon, a .-. and ._. emoticon and all of those emoticons are located around the exclamation marks, at 0.5 transparency and with various rotations. This icon is recycled from [[The Middleline]], being its old icon.

==Trivia==
*This difficulties icon was originally [[File:The MiddlelineNew.png|frameless|25x25px]] [[The Middleline]]’s icon, but it got replaced with a newer icon so it got separated into its own difficulty.
*There has been a lot of debate over where buildability ends and where unbuildability starts. This difficulty hopes to stop debate over it.
*This difficulty resided between the penultimate Peak Class 14 difficulty [[File:Imageforsomething....png|25px|link=Eɼɼosion]] [[Eɼɼosion]], and the first anonymous placement difficulty of its class, [[File:Confusion.webp|25px|link=Confusion]] [[Confusion]] prior to TDEx.
==Continuing on from this point==
From this point on, towers will start to become exceedingly more inaccurate than they were previously, and it will take a heavy toll on your goals to get through this chart. I implore you to go to [[File:Stardark.png|25px|link=Stardark]] [[File:StardarkText.png|link=Stardark|60px]], however.
