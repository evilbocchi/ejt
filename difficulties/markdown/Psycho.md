# Psycho

Psycho is a High Class 2 difficulty, located between C0RrUpT and Harsh. It is one of the last non-soul crushing difficulties before entering the Soul-Crushing range. Obstacles become increasingly absurd and challenging, pushing players toward the edge of sanity. The icon is a solid purple, and the difficulty is known for its tough, skill-based gameplay.
