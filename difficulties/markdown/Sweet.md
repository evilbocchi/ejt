# Sweet

Sweet is a Mid Class 1 difficulty on the Difficulty Chart. This is when the difficulty starts to ramp up, requiring jumping, walking, and avoiding escapable holes. Towers or obbies in this difficulty should be attempted after beating a Starter or Cakewalk difficulty. Sweet has two sub-difficulties: Sugary and Aesthetic. The difficulty was revived after being removed for low quality and now sits between Cakewalk and Lovely.
