==What is '''[[No|<span style="color:#505050">'''No'''</span>]]'''?==
'''[[No|<span style="color:#505050">'''No'''</span>]]''' is a difficulty that is assigned to towers that are harder than [[WHY|<span style="color:#000000;-webkit-text-stroke-color:white;-webkit-text-stroke-width:0.5px;">'''WHY'''</span>]] difficulty, but easier than [[DEATH]]. It is represented with the stone gray [<span style="color:#505050">'''80,80,80'''</span>] fading into black, a stone gray outline and a white ".-." in the middle.  

Obstacles in this difficulty have broken logic and jumps that can't be done usually. Obstacles of this difficulty are either obstacles that have phased out of possibility due to updates or only possible with TAS. This is the first difficulty that has humanly impossible jumps (9+), so from this point towers cannot be properly rated. 

==Towers==
*ToTAS - [[Tower of Tedious and Stodgy]] (?)
*MEaTLoAF - [[Maybe Eating a True Loaf of Absolute Failure]]

*This difficulty was made by [https://roblox.com/users/1710070/profile Bob_9001].
