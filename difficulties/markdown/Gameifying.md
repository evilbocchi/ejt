# Gameifying

Gameifying is a joke entry in the difficulty chart, referencing a Roblox game that was never fully developed. The page notes that the game hasn't been worked on since June 2023 and is considered outdated. It serves as a humorous placeholder, reminding players to "touch grass" and not take it seriously.
