# Sacrificingly Impossible

Sacrificingly Impossible (S.I) is a Class 8 sub-difficulty, formerly Class 11, located in the middle range of Physically Impossible challenges. It cannot be completed by humans or TAS, requiring nearly perfect precision and often exceeding the limits of the Roblox physics engine. Obstacles are harder than those in Dilly Impossible, and the difficulty sits between COMMUNISM and Satan Tartarus Lucifer Void. S.I represents a significant leap in challenge, demanding feats that are virtually unattainable.
