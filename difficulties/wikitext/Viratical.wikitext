==What is [[File:Viratical.png|30px]] <span style="background:linear-gradient(green,yellow,red); -webkit-background-clip:text !important; -webkit-text-fill-color:transparent;">'''Viratical'''</span>?==
[[File:Viratical.png|30x30px]] <span style="background:linear-gradient(green,yellow,red); -webkit-background-clip:text !important; -webkit-text-fill-color:transparent;">'''Viratical'''</span> is a devilish difficulty, and is the [[penultimate]] difficulty of The End of the Official Chart (C10). It is in High Class 10, and is located succeeding [[File:Ohnoez.png|30px]] <span style="background:linear-gradient(yellow,white); -webkit-background-clip:text !important; -webkit-text-fill-color:transparent;">[[Oh Noez!]]</span>, and preceding [[File:Pinnacle.png|frameless|31x31px]] [[Pinnacle]]. You may be on the last difficulty before you face the End of The [[Main Difficulty Chart|Main Chart]], but that doesn’t mean it’ll be easy. This difficulty stretches the ultimate border between fiction and non-fiction, completely nullifying any type of TAS, or hacks, and your roblox character will be decimated by a spinner at the speed of sound, before you even realize.

Overall, you most likely will never end up beating this, as there’s a limit of capabilities in everything.

==Icon Representation==
[[File:Viratical.png|center|frameless|60x60px]]
[[File:Viratical.png|30x30px]] <span style="background:linear-gradient(green,yellow,red); -webkit-background-clip:text !important; -webkit-text-fill-color:transparent;">Viratical</span>’s icon is not too bleak, but not too over-the-top either. It is memorable and recognizable. There is a light green to light red gradient, with a hint of light yellowish orange (light gold) in the middle. There is yellow ‘?..?’ text in the middle, with a dark yellow outline, and the eastern emoticon for ‘being irritated’ is found in the bottom left corner, with the same characteristics as the middle text, and the eastern emoticon for ‘getting angry’ emoticon is found in the top right of the icon.

==Trivia==

*This difficulty was made because OrbentuneAlt said in [[Apocalyptic]]’s comments, in quotation marks:  “''Just imagine another difficulty comes in...''  ''*I make a difficulty called Viratical*''  ''"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAa"''  ''-Apocalyptic, RIP''”
**However, it is in a completely different placement.
**OrbentuneAlt was planning to make Viratical a "'''Virus'''" Difficulty.
***This obviously didn't make the cut though.
***Not the computer virus ones, a real virus (that got exported from a computer virus).

==Continuing on from this point==
You.... you... how are you so skilled? You can’t be human, we learnt that many classes ago. You can’t be a life form either, we learnt that ages and ages ago. You can’t even be a divine being, as this is fictional. Well, congratulations.. being. Now that you’re.. most likely in a black void with only you and your computer, you have conquered the penultimate challenge of The [[Main Difficulty Chart]], and have proved yourself great enough to enter the end of the main chart. [[File:Pinnacle.png|frameless|31x31px]] [[Pinnacle]] will probably be your stopping point. Considering the fact that anything beyond Pinnacle breaks Roblox and enters fiction, it’s safe to say you will not conquer the chart. You’re still so far away from [[File:Final.png|frameless|50x50px]] [[The Final Difficulty.|The Final Difficulty]], and yet you think you can surpass fiction, and even complete something beyond the necessity of infinity? Well, good luck is all I give, my friend.{{DifficultiesNavbox}}
