# Dreadful.exe

Dreadful.exe is a class 7 difficulty, placed after Mortifying and preceding Transfinite. This is an ".exe" difficulty, themed as an application that can modify your computer or your screen.

Towers in this difficulty are not only extremely challenging, but also feature unfair catches, such as covering your screen with ">:D" signs. Obstacles are incredibly unforgiving, often causing you to lose all your progress by failing a single jump. Attempting a tower in this difficulty requires practicing obstacles blindfolded and with other unfair catches, as well as practicing them normallyâ€”and possibly even practicing some obstacles in real life. Completing a tower in this difficulty would be incredibly difficult and a renowned achievement for any obbyist. In fact, completing any obstacle in this difficulty would be an achievement that no obbyist has ever accomplished.
