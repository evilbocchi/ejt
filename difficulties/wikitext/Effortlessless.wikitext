[[File:EffortlesslessIconOoIDC.png|frameless|30x30px]] <span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:100%;background:-webkit-linear-gradient(330deg, skyblue, white);-webkit-background-clip:text;-webkit-text-fill-color:transparent;">'''Effortlessless'''</span> is a '''EET''' difficulty, located in Peak Class 1. This difficulty is the final barrier before the EToH difficulties, being easier than {{Class1Difficulties|Effortless}} [[w:c:jtoh:Effortless|Effortless]], but harder than [[File:Magnificent Current.png|30px]] [[Magnificent]]. This is the first difficulty with actual obstacles in it, just imagine any obstacle that could be beaten by anybody. 

It is not a joke like most of the other lower difficulties, but rather now can be played by beginners who have little to no experience with obbies. You won't struggle here, and you will easily get to the next difficulty. This is like a "tutorial", because there are now new jumps instead of simply holding keys or just existing. 

You're likely going to win, most people do not find this as a challenge. This is the difficulty a newbie should start at if they're experienced at Roblox. Difficulties placed lower than this may be a good training tool for AI.

This color is a vibrant, light purple (#AAABED). Very simple, right?

==Trivia== 

*In JET, it is the equivalent of  {{Class2Difficulties|Remorseless}} {{jtoh|Remorseless}}. 
**Is Gravel the equivalent of [[C0RrUpT]], then?
*This was revamped on the 4th of July by [[User:Viranenthusiast|Viranenthusiast]]. 
*Because this difficulty includes "less" twice, they cancel out so this difficulty could also be called "Effort", which is very different from what this difficulty is supposed to be. You could also argue it would be [[File:Effortful.png|30x30px]] [[Effortful]], which is even further off.
*

== Continuing from this point==
Congratulations, after beating this difficulty, you’re finally ready for the EToH difficulties. Start with {{Class1Difficulties|Effortless}} [[w:c:jtoh:Effortless|Effortless]]. However, you may want to complete the sub-difficulties of this, which you are free to do. If so, {{Class0Difficulties|Gravel}} [[Gravel]] is your best bet at this point.
