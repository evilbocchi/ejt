# Delightful

Delightful is a Class 1 sub-difficulty, originating as a recommended replacement image for "Happy" and evolving into a high Class 1 challenge. It follows Tutorial and precedes TooEasy, serving as a sub-difficulty of Tutorial. Delightful introduces slightly harder gameplay, such as 0.3 stud wraps, while maintaining a friendly and positive atmosphere. It marks the point where obstacles start to require more skill, but still remains accessible to most players.
