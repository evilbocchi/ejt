== What is <span style="color:#7D007D;">'''[[File:Unimpossible New.png|41x41px]] Unimpossible'''</span>?==
[[File:Unimpossible New.png|41x41px]] <span style="color:#7D007D;">'''Unimpossible'''</span> is the fourth difficulty of the entire [[Main Difficulty Chart|Difficulty Chart]], and is therefore a [[:Category:Class Negative|Class Negative]] difficulty. As its name suggests, this is the complete opposite of impossibility, and is transmaximally easy. You are always completing this difficulty, as with every beyond existence difficulty.

It's the complete antipode of [[File:Skypoint.png|frameless|25x25px]] [[Undefinable]], it also succeeds {{Class-1Difficulties|Negativity|25px}} [[Negativity]], yet precedes [[File:FPnew.png|25px]] [[Friendliness]]. It also contains 2 subs being {{Class-1Difficulties|Almost Unimpossible|25px}} [[User blog:Oh Noez! Oh Noez!/Almost Unimpossible|Almost Unimpossible]], and {{Class-1Difficulties|Unpossible|25px}} [[User blog:Oh Noez! Oh Noez!/Ununpossible|Ununpossible]], even though both of them are now [[Community Difficulty Chart|CDC]] exclusive.

==Trivia==
*This was previously owned by [[User:Astrominal|Astrominal]], but was then transferred to vira.

*An obstacle section and continuing on section are not to be added due to them being totally pointless.
