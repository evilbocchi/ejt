=='''What is Interruption?'''==
'''Interruption''' is a sub-difficulty that has humanly impossible obstacles. This difficulty is basically harder than [[File:Non-Transparent Delete.png|frameless|26px]] '''[[DELETE]]''' and currently easier than [[File:Xi-Alpha revamp icon.png|frameless|26px]] '''[[Xi-Alpha]]''' (previously [[File:Unaware.jpg|frameless|26px]] ''Unstable'' and [[File:Derpy.png|frameless|26px]] ''Derpy'' (Sub-Sub-Difficulty)). So, you're probably not going to be completing this difficulty anytime soon. 

You would immediately fail once you jump. When you are trying to be attempt any obstacles in this difficulty, you would get distracted and get interripted. Why would you even do this? There isn't such a way one or multiple humans would beat this. You cannot avoid anything in this difficulty and it is completely annoying. 

== Icon Representation ==
There is a funny grump face in the middle of the screen with gray gradient on top and bottom. This picture is showing that you are getting interrupted just like the name of the difficulty.

==Obstacles In Interruption==

*23.5 Stud Long jump (Climbable)
*22.3 Stud Long jump (Unclimbable)
*7x3.5 Stud stick out
*21 Stud Wrap
*23.85 Stud High Jump
*Jump on a 0.01 Stud Around it 40 times without falling
*19 Stud Instant Kill-brick Wrap
*Focus on an hour of homework with 4 random people trying to distract you without getting tired or distracted
*Beat Hello neighbor in 300 seconds

== Towers in this difficulty ==

* Obelisk of Being Interrupted (OoBI) (Fictional)
* Tower of Interruptionâ€™s Strongest Heights (ToISH) (Fictional)
* Steeple of Nuisances and Annoyances (SoNaA) (Fictional)

==Trivia==

*The original creator made this difficulty with a random face that I drew on Free Draw 2. I start to like it and make a difficulty about it.
*The image is draw with cursor without tool. And the top of the picture has darker gray than the bottom one.
*There is another phase which is '''''PHASE 2.''''' But the original creator was not sure to make it yet. It is unlikely to come since the original creator has not been active in JJT for a while.

==Continuing from this point==
Welp, since you manage to pass this humanly impossible difficulty, you are actually a true legend who has pass many difficulties. You are allowed to move to [[File:Xi-Alpha revamp icon.png|frameless|30x30px]] '''[[Xi-Alpha]]''' and I really doubt you to suffer right there. You are clearly got qualified.  {{DifficultiesNavbox}}
