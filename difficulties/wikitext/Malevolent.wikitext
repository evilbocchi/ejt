<h2 class="head">What is [[File:Malevolent.png|25px]] <span id="malevolent">Malevolent</span>?</h2>
[[File:Malevolent.png|25px]] <span id="malevolent">Malevolent</span> is a Peak Class 4 sub-difficulty of {{Class6Difficulties|Malicious}} [[w:c:jtohs-hardest-towers:Malicious|Malicious]] that comes after [[File:Autism but resized.png|25px]] [[Autism]], but before [[File:BuildingNew.png|25px]] [[Building]]. This difficulty is categorized in the Human Impossibility category, experiencing the factuality that raw human skill is not enough to be able to conquer this difficulty. One would be better off using other assists to aid them in their journey, such as modifying jump power and speed attributes. 

This was also formerly regarded as the TAS limit because the creator had found out on YouTube that the hardest legitimate jump using a normal TAS (no modifications, no exploits, no glitches, just a normal TAS) documented on YouTube is a 15.5 stud jump, and the hardest wraparound documented on YouTube using a legitimate TAS is around 15 studs. However, this was inconsistent with the way TAS operates, hence it is just another meaningless difficulty.

Anyone attempting this cannot consistently do these jumps even with the utilisation of '''Tool Assisted Speedrun''', and as such towers in this difficulty still aren’t completely TAS possible. However, as human skill keeps increasing, so will the size of the jumps doable with TAS. So, given a few years, towers in this difficulty will be TAS possible.

<h2 class="head">Trivia</h2>
*This could have been considered a sequel to [[File:TheHumanLimit.png|25px]] [[The Human Limit]].
*Hypothetically, if JToH utilised the JHT chart instead of the normal chart, this would be the equivalent of TooHard.
*Prior to the ODC becoming the SDC, and this difficulties loss of fabled status, this was a fabled difficulty.
*Prior to the deprecation of the TAS standard, this was potentially within a volatile portion of the chart. Thus, people were hypothetically free to move it with actual justification.
*This difficulty was previously called '''Tool Assisted Speedrun'''.
<h2 class="head">Continuing on from this point</h2>
One completing this difficulty would have formerly been forced to use other methods in order to beat difficulties now, like exploits. If they wanted to, one would progress onto [[File:BuildingNew.png|25px]] [[Building]], which is the first difficulty of Class 5, or [[File:MaliciouszetaNEW.png|25px]] [[User blog:EpicTheGamer2014/Malicious-Zeta|Malicious-Zeta]] within the CDC.
