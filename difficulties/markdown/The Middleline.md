# The Middleline

The Middleline is the third of the Primordials and is the only Peak Class 10 difficulty. It is located halfway between The First Difficulty and The Final Difficulty. Due to its position on the chart, it cannot be built or beaten. Obstacles of this difficulty are unfathomably absurd and will never be accomplished by any form of tool assistance, as any potential help is neutralized upon entry.

This difficulty is rated extremely high, with a Metris value of exactly 2000, as it sits in the exact middle of the chart and the Metris spectrum. The Middleline represents the midpoint of all classes and is a true test of skill, far beyond what is possible in normal gameplay.
