[[File:Absolutism.png|frameless|30x30px]] <span style="background:linear-gradient(180deg,blue,black); -webkit-background-clip:text !important; -webkit-text-fill-color:transparent;">'''Absolutism'''</span> is a Mid Class 6 difficulty which is harder than [[File:Creepy epic face.gif|30px]] [[D-I-E]], yet easier than [[File:Insistent.png|30px]] [[Insistent]]. At this point, going any further is highly ill advised, I don't even know why you are still persisting when this is obviously impossible, and not even humanly impossible at that, there isn't any point to this, so why are you spending decades of your lifespan to impossibly hard difficulties in a Lego game, not even an actual parkour game at that?

I think it's obvious by now that this will require unfathomable amount of luck that not even luck manipulators can't obtain reliably, and that the skill you will need is through the roof. I recommend you to begin to practice a LOT if you wanna have a chance at this difficulty.

==Icon Representation==
[[File:Absolutism.png|center|frameless|100x100px]]
The icon is relatively vertical gradient going from '''blue''' to black, yes, '''blue''' to black. On top of this is a black '''Ï–''' symbol and a blue outline with some glow around it. There is also 2 transparent black and blue texts that read "You have seen a lot of red lately." and "Have something new." respectively. Yes, simple, but still effective.

==Trivia==

* This difficulty was deleted 2 hours after being created, simply because a few people decided to do a little bit of trolling.
*At one point, this icon for this difficulty had a chance to turn into a standard red and black icon through a poll, however, a large majority voted for the blue icon instead of the red icon.

==Continuing on from this point==
Huge congratulations on beating [[File:Absolutism.png|frameless|30x30px]] <span style="background:linear-gradient(180deg,blue,black); -webkit-background-clip:text !important; -webkit-text-fill-color:transparent;">'''Absolutism'''</span>! At this point, you are beginning to reach the end of Class 6, and it is only going to get harder from here, so it's recommended to take a break for now. Regain your motivation, give yourself a well deserved rest, and when you are ready, get back into the obby scene and begin practising some more. When you feel like you've practised enough, continue onto Exi- [[File:Insistent.png|30px]] [[Insistent]] for your next difficulty. Good luck.
