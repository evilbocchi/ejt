# Pre-Excavation Chain

The Excavation Chain is based on the game Button Simulator: Excavation Discoveries and consists of 30 different difficulties. Created by Sanjay2133, these difficulties are themed on the normal stats of Button Simulator: ED. The chain is a unique branch within the difficulty chart, with each difficulty inspired by in-game stats and progression.
