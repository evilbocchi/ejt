==What is '''El Vacio'''?==
[[File:El Vacio Sqaure.png|frameless|30x30px]] <span style="background:linear-gradient(90deg,white,grey,white); -webkit-background-clip:text !important; -webkit-text-fill-color:transparent;">'''El Vacio'''</span> is the spanish for '''THE VOID'''. The original icon resembles an SMG4 poorly edited picture that was made creepier. (It was originally going to be black with SCP-087 face and XD on it, which I think is more nightmare fuel.) As for the current icon, it is not as creepy as [[File:Roor hell.jpeg|frameless|30x30px]] <span style="background:linear-gradient(90deg,black,red,black); -webkit-background-clip:text !important; -webkit-text-fill-color:transparent;">'''[[RoorHELL]]'''</span>, [[File:Creepy epic face.gif|frameless|30x30px]] <span style="background:linear-gradient(90deg,grey,white,black); -webkit-background-clip:text !important; -webkit-text-fill-color:transparent;">'''[[D-I-E]]'''</span> or [[File:Screen Shot 2020-08-13 at 1.20.05 PM.png|frameless|30x30px]]  <span style="background:linear-gradient(90deg,black,grey,black); -webkit-background-clip:text !important; -webkit-text-fill-color:transparent;">'''[[Nonexistent]]'''</span>. Obbies with this difficulty should be miles harder than [[File:Jes.png|frameless|30x30px]] <span style="background:linear-gradient(120deg,#04fe94,#06fe98); -webkit-background-clip:text !important; -webkit-text-fill-color:transparent;">'''[[Jesus Ballin']]'''</span> and It should be ultimately impossible. seriously, do not even think about beating this difficulty. Every obstacles in this difficulty are very rarely to be seen and very hard to be manuevered. As for now, this difficulty is buffed and it's a lot harder than Jesus Ballin, maybe universe disruption or even Aleph-cow and very rarely Megadeath depends on how do you design your obstacle.  Attempting an obstacle of this difficulty will cause imminent death. The Decal id of the difficulty is: 7281337903.

== Continuing from this point==
You can do [[File:Jes.png|Frameless|30x30px]] <span style="background:linear-gradient(120deg,#04fe94,#06fe98); -webkit-background-clip:text !important; -webkit-text-fill-color:transparent;">'''[[Jesus Ballin']]'''</span> again if u want to. I doubt you want to as the suffering there was pretty painful. Fine. You want even more challenges? Even though it will just lead to your death, go to [[File:Screen Shot 2020-08-18 at 5.44.16 PM.png|frameless|30x30px]] [[Universe Disruption]]. That difficulty is beyond this and it should provide you a challenge for quite a bit.
