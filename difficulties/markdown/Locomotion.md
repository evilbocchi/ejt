# Locomotion

Locomotion is a Class 0, humanly possible, unofficial difficulty that introduces players to conveyors as a means of transport. Created by Astro6284, it is placed after Happylike and before Walkthrough. The main challenge is learning to use fast conveyors, which move players or objects to different locations.

Locomotion is the last "break" difficulty before the main chart begins. The icon features a red-to-light-red gradient with a dark-red arrow. Obstacles involve riding conveyors of various speeds and angles, preparing players for more complex challenges ahead.
