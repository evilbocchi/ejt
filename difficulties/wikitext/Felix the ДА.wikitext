==What is '''Felix the ДА'''?==
'''Felix the ДА''' is a difficulty, somehow laying in between [[A]] and [[Exist]]. You don't even have to exist to complete this! I mean, all of the difficulties before this one said that too, so whatever. 

Felix is a simplistic difficulty no one can ever lose. It is truly impossible to lose something this pathetic. (True, that was said in the above paragraph but I’m out of ideas) It is the opposite of  Felix the нет. Да in Russian means Yes, by the way.

*This is impossible to lose as it's impossible to win Felix the нет, you have beaten this at least once even before you have existed.
*This is the last difficulty that doesn't require you to exist.
*The joke Felix the ДА comes from Vinesauce Joel where he played a Russian bootleg game containing Felix the Cat. In the continue screen of that game you can see ДА and нет meaning yes and no.
