# Strenuous

Strenuous is a Mid Class 2 Sub-Difficulty that is harder than Difficult but easier than Menacing. It is the last difficulty of Mid Class 2, and jumps here start to get harder. This difficulty is a significant step up from what a normal player could generally accomplish without assists. Players are encouraged to practice Hard and Difficult obstacles to prepare for Strenuous.
