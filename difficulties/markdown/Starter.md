# Starter

Starter is a Class 1 Normal Difficulty intended for beginners. It marks the start of jumping, falling, and walking combined in one difficulty, serving as the first tutorial on your path. This is the end of the Starter Zone, and most players are able to beat Starter. It is harder than Jumpless and is followed by Sweet (or Cakewalk). Starter also introduces premade obbies that fit the difficulty and offer a skill test. The popularity of this difficulty has increased over time, making it one of the most popular Class 1 difficulties.
