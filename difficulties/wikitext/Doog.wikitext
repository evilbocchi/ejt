==''The Origin of The Image.''==
''"Smile Dog (also known smile.jpg) is a supposedly "haunted" image dating back to the beginnings of the internet, smile.jpg has a reputation for driving those who view it insane, making its victims view it in their mind's eye at every turn. While it has been discovered that these images in victims' minds are the result of epileptic seizures, there is no clear understanding of why the image causes this. All the victims who spoke up about their experiences however, have said that they are also visited by the dog-like creature in the image, named "Smile Dog". When in these dreams, the only thing the victims can do is watch and listen as Smile Dog tells them that the only respite to their torment is to "spread the word", and many of them receive shortly thereafter a removable media via mail without a return address. Inside these media is said to be another copy or form of Smile Dog, which the victim is encouraged to spread to others."''
