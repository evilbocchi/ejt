{{Header|Trivia}}
*This is the first event difficulty to be added to '''EToH''', the second being [[OooOOOoOOOOooo above catastrophic difficulty OoOOooOOoo|<span style="color:#000000;">oooOOOoOOOOooo above catastrophic difficulty OoOOooOOoo</span>]] and the third being '''[[Sisyphean|<span style="color:#969664;">Sisyphean</span>]]'''.
**'''oooOOOoOOOOooo above catastrophic difficulty OoOOooOOoo''' and '''Sisyphean''' were also added in an April Fools event.
*This has the widest difficulty range out of any difficulty in the game, from just climbing a truss all the way to Floor 10 to having a non-functioning winpad.
