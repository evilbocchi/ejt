[[File:Frick you (3).png|frameless|30x30px]] '''Bad Request''' is the sub-difficulty of  [[File: Illegal Newest.png |frameless|30x30px]] [[Illegal]], in Class 7. It comes before [[File:New_UG.jpg|32x32px]] [[Universal Glitch]], and it has a rating of ''68.5''. Here's a fun fact: This is absolutely ridiculous. It's basically torture to even try to play this because of how fast you'll die. A fun day, for sure.

It's getting harder and harder to build these difficulties, and [[The Final Difficulty.|the end]] isn't even in sight. I would tell you to stop whatever it is you're doing and get a life, but I know you aren't gonna do that. I just don't know what else to say to you, seriously. Don't even try.

==Icon Representation==
This difficulty's icon is the graphic formerly used for errors on the ROBLOX website, but edited to look gloomy and dark. The background is dark grey, and Builderman, who was simply tripping in the original image, seems to be dead. His eyes are removed, and there is a hole next to the mouth. The decal can be found [https://www.roblox.com/library/6789034664/Bad-Request-Difficulty here].

==Continuing on==
Okay, so you did it. Honestly, I can't even be bothered to act surprised that you did it. Why should I? In fact, why am I acting like you beat it at all just because you scrolled to the bottom of this page? You can't beat it by scrolling. That's like [[Disco]]. Just move on to [[File:New_UG.jpg|32x32px]] [[Universal Glitch]] or whatever's after this.{{DifficultiesNavbox}}
