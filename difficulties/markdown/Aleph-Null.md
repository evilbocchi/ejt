# Aleph-Null

Aleph-Null is a Class 4 difficulty, originally from the JToH's Hardest Towers wiki before being transferred to JJT. It is impossible to complete without a Tool-Assisted Speedrun (TAS), marking the start of Peak Class 4. Even completing a TAS here is a monumental achievement. Aleph-Null is known for its iconic symbol and represents the beginning of truly insurmountable challenges.
