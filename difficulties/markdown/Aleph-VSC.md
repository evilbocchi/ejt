# Aleph-VSC

Aleph-VSC is a Class 9 Difficulty. It is way harder than Rush yet still easier than the extremely horrifying difficulty Misery. Aleph-VSC is considered to be a Devillish or Physically Impossible difficulty, meaning no matter what you can not do a single jump in such a difficulty. LITERALLY. Jumps in Aleph-VSC seem to defy logic, having game-breaking bugs and impossibly long distance jumps. This difficulty also has numerous catches, all making it even harder.

Aleph-VSC has a rating of 92. For reference, Supreme's rating is just 60, and Megadeath's is 75. If you were to attempt to measure the tier of such a difficulty similar to Aleph-VSC, it would likely land in the trillions. (probably 100,000 as The Middleline is 1,000,000th tier)

It is impossible to tier such a beast of a difficulty. In Kol Metris, Aleph-VSC would land at around 1900. Such hard difficulties as Aleph-VSC require game-breaking bugs and indescribably long jumps.
