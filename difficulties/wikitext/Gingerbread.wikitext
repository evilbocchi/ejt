<span style="color:#6C584B">[[Gingerbread]]</span> is a miscellaneous [[difficulty]] and the placeholder difficulty of '''EToH'''. It is represented by a strange-looking gingerbread man and uses the color brown for the difficulty chart and win messages. It became initially well-known when it was used as a placeholder difficulty for the monthly tower [[Tower of Is Steeple Crossing Required?]].

It originated as an inside joke during the judging of the [[Garden of Eesh√∂l]] submissions where if a difficulty could not be decided, the staff would just post gingerbread GIFs instead.<ref>"[https://discord.com/channels/551741409624064011/551911984149299220/1004930841471881236 and that it started from an inside joke in garden of eeshol judging where we used to post gingerbread gifs when we had no idea what the difficulty was]" - {{PlayerName|Gammattor}}</ref> Despite this humorous origin, it exists as a semi-official difficulty according to {{PlayerName|Gammattor}}.<ref>The same way that the [[Thanos (Difficulty)|<span id="Thanos">'''Thanos'''</span>]] difficulty is official as confirmed: "[https://discord.com/channels/551741409624064011/551911984149299220/1004931475348668538 yes]" - {{PlayerName|Gammattor}}</ref>
