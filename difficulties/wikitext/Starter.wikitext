<span style="background:linear-gradient(90deg,yellow,skyblue,green); -webkit-background-clip:text !important; -webkit-text-fill-color:transparent;">[[Starter]] </span>is a [[:Category:Class 1|Class 1]] Normal Difficulty made by [[File:TDE.png|25px|link=User:Viranenthusiast]] [[User:Viranenthusiast|Viranenthusiast]]. This Difficulty is intended for beginners, it also marks the start of jumping, falling and walking combined in one Difficulty. That is why this can also be deemed as the first Tutorial on your path. This means this is the end of <span style="background:linear-gradient(90deg,yellow,skyblue,green); -webkit-background-clip:text !important; -webkit-text-fill-color:transparent;">'''The Starter Zone.''' </span> Most obbyists are obviously able to beat [[Starter]]. 

This Difficulty is harder then {{Class0Difficulties|Jumpless}} [[Jumpless]], the 2nd last difficulty of the beginning, whereas the difficulty located right after this is [[File:Sweet (New).png|30x30px]] [[Sweet]] (or ''[[File:CakeWalk.png|30px]]'' [[Cakewalk]]). '''Starter''' also features something new, something never before seen to EJT. Premade Obbies! 

These obbies are just obbies but premade, they fit the Difficulty and offer a skill test. At the end of the Difficulty, the 3 obbies serve as the Finale. Other then that, '''Starter''' is one of the first Difficulties made in 2022. Starter has also been featured in alot of Difficulty Chart obbies. The popularity of this difficulty has increased alot overtime, and now it's one of the most popular Class 1 Difficulties !

==Icon representation==

===Official Icon===
The Official Icon represents a pixelated stick figure in the color of the so called "Noob Skin" standing on top of a hill which gets darker the more to the middle of the hill. There is also a sky behind it that gets darker the more it goes to the corners, with 2 clouds in it of course which you would just notice already. There is a myth of the image that the noob later got struck by lightning when there was a thunderstorm.

===Joke Icon===
The Joke icon is, lets just say, a low budget version of the Official Icon. The hill is flat and is only 1 shade of green. The Sky is also just a square but blue, the noob is colored differently and has a different smile, there is white surrounding of the image and the noob obviously has a way bigger taller then the normal one. This Icon was made by Oh Noez! Oh Noez! in a game of Garticphone when Krazy/Crazy decided to make the Sentence: Starter from EJT

---- 

== The Three Obbies==
''These 3 obbies are the key of Starter. These obbies round up the Tutorial in a skill test, the skill of patience, determination and strength. Will you pass? I think you will, good luck!''
*<big>Obby 1 - Happiness</big> 
**This is the first obby of them all. Heres a guide to it: When you spawn in, you need to do a 2.5 studs jump onto a 5x5 stud platform. Then you do a 2.45 stud stickin followed by a 10 stud fall in a 5x5 stud gap. When you fell down, you have to do a 5 studs wide tightrope for 20 studs and do 3 1.33 stud high jumps. After that you should do a 3 stud jump lowered by 3 studs and then you beat it!
*<big>Obby 2 - Enjoyment</big> 
**After you beat the first obby, you press a button which will activate an obby for 10 minutes. Heres how you beat it, you start off by doing a 2.55 stickin followed by a 1.3 stud high jump. Fall 15 studs with a 1x1 stud CanCollide: False killbrick in the hole. Then you do a 4x16 stud tightrope followed by a 2 stud jump. The final part is a seat part you will walk over and need to jump to get out. After that you beat it.
*<big>Obby 3 - Pleasant</big>
** Walk 100 studs and wait for 5 seconds afterwards. After that you do 4 2.33 stud jumps followed by jumping over 3 1x1 stud killbricks. Then do a 10x50 stud tightrope with 10 kb's that deal damage. Then you go into a room and jump on a character model. As final obstacle you do a 2.8 studs stickin that is 25 studs long with multiple 2 stud jumps in it. And there you go, you beat all obbies!
==Obby Catches==   
*Sometimes, a hamburger can spawn that you can pick up for healing
*There is 50% chance a safety net will spawn underneath every 30 seconds
*Every 5 minutes, the obby changes itself
*You can also beat it by doing 3 8 stud jumps
*There is chance that the obby becomes upside down and gravity gets flipped
*You can do a 13 stud jump if you want (there is no reward)

*[[Starter]] is the first difficulty that features an obbies section.
*This difficulty doesnt use spinners.

== Continuing on==
Well, it wasn't that hard but you proved you are a starter player and not just a player that sucks at obbies. Go to [[File:CakeWalk.png|30px]] [[Cakewalk]] as your next challenge. But, you may take a skip to Class 2 already. Class 1 is just a practice place, not actual obbies. Well, cya!
