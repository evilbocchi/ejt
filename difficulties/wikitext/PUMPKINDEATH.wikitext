== Information - PUMPKINDEATH ==
PUMPKINDEATH is an event difficulty that is located in Class 30, making this one of the hardest collaboration difficulties in this wiki. It's harder than [[File:Uncomputable.png|30px]] [[Uncomputable]], a very complicated difficulty with a simple icon, and [[File:Ee.png|30px]] [[Effortful]], the end of obstacles.

What separates this difficulty from the rest is pure spook. Every single obstacle is loaded with nightmares and scariness, making it impossible to step without getting scared out of your mind.

Obstacles in this difficulty are so inconceivably difficult that even the most basic jumps have so many warped properties that break all forms of logic to something that no one can recognize. This difficulty uses numbers so big that they dwarf G64, TREE(3), RAYO, and even some infinite numbers. Even with these inconceivably large numbers, this difficulty is still far from the last one in the chart. Time to continue the Trick-or-Treat tradition, but this time... 

'''Trick is the only option'''.

==Catches==
The catches of this difficulty are Halloween themed, probably because this is a Halloween event difficulty. There are 3 major catches that this difficulty has.
*There are roughly F<sub>0</sub> bats that are hard-coded to chase you, and if you touch one, you get IP banned
*Every single stud is loaded with F<sub>0</sub> gallons of nightmare fuel.
*Your head is larger than the observable universe.
*Every plank time, you drink a witch's potion, but the effects are multiplied by the F<sub>0</sub>-bit integer limit. The witch's potion kills you.
*You have a F<sub>F<sub>0</sub></sub>% chance of dying if you don't say "Happy Halloween!" every plank time. If you do, you have a F<sub>0</sub>% chance.
*'''If you think of anything other than Halloween, you immediately die, and have to restart your entire journey.'''
*You have to wear a pumpkin that has the density of a neutron star.
*You have to eat F<sub>0</sub> gigatons of poisonous candy every plank time.
*'''Before you start the first jump, go to every single house in every single universe and collect one piece of candy. If you do not get to every house and get every single piece of candy in 10^-'''<math>\sum_{k=1}^\infty\underbrace{ k^k \cdots k^k}_{F_0}</math> '''plank time, you immediately die, and have to restart your entire journey.'''
*Every time you do a jump, you have to beat every JToH Halloween event so far F<sub>F<sub>F<sub>F<sub>F<sub>0</sub></sub></sub></sub></sub>  times.
**This includes jumps you do when beating the JToH Halloween events.
*Every jump has a jumpscare that gives you F<sub>F<sub>0</sub></sub> heart attacks.
*You have to do every Minecraft SpookyJam modpack on curseforge at the same time while also trying to complete the difficulty
**If you don't play every Minecraft SpookyJam modpack on curseforge at the same time while trying to complete this difficulty, you have to play every Minecraft expert modpack in existence as punishment
***You also have to play every Minecraft expert modpack in existence while playing every Minecraft SpookyJam modpack on curseforge at the same time.
*When you attempt this difficulty, you get sent to a cave with a variety of spooky creatures such as skeletons, zombies, witches, and bats, and there is F<sub>F<sub>F<sub>F<sub>F<sub>F<sub>F<sub>F<sub>F<sub>F<sub>0</sub></sub></sub></sub></sub></sub></sub></sub></sub></sub> of each and they go towards you at F<sub>F<sub>0</sub></sub> times the speed of light.
**If you try to leave the cave (which is impossible because you can't even move one Planck length due to the speed of the spooky creatures), one of two things will happen, if you are playing this difficulty in a difficulty chart tower, you have to restart the difficulty chart tower, or if you are trying to beat every tower in order of increasing difficulty, you have to restart all the way back at The First Difficulty's towers and get all the way back to a tower of this difficulty in less than a day.
*You may only attempt or practice this difficulty at the exact plank time it hits midnight on October 31.
*You get jumpscared F<sub>F<sub>F<sub>F<sub>F<sub>0</sub></sub></sub></sub></sub> times every -F<sub>0</sub> seconds, and every jumpscare gives you F<sub>F<sub>F<sub>0</sub></sub></sub> heart attacks.
*You've gotten Type F<sub>0</sub> diabetes from all the candy you ate, and it's also made you extremely ill, both physically and mentally.

== Continuing on ==
As you reach the outer edges of the JJT chart, you seem to feel like the difficulties before this point took much less time to beat than this one. You feel a sense of dread as you don't seem to know what obstacles await you beyond this difficulty. All you know is that the Halloween themed stuff here is way less scary than what lies ahead. Uncertainty and fear washes over you as you enter the difficulty known as [[Effortful]] lol jk you're forced to go past it and to...
=oOoOoOoOo detos squad spooky oOoOoOoOo=
{{NewDifficultyInfobox|title1=oOoOoOoOo detos squad spooky oOoOoOoOo|image1=oOoOoOoOo detos squad spooky oOoOoOoOo.png|caption1=how spooky|class=30|rating=Utter Oblivion|previous=[[Effortful]]|next=[[Undefinable]]|main_difficulty=[[Effortful]]|creator(s)=KoolTheEpic|decal_id=14952800421}}

== PUMPKINDEATH - VARIATION #1 ==
You thought it was over? No. Welcome to oOoOoOoOo detos squad spooky oOoOoOoOo, This variation of PUMPKINDEATH is harder than the difficulty. This difficulty could also be considered a "Phase 2" version of PUMPKINDEATH because it is harder. Since this difficulty transcends [[Effortful]], obstacles in this difficulty cannot be defined very well.

(Edit, can't be defined or thought of, as you know, it's beyond the Absolute Limit of Obstacles.)

== Catches ==
*ALL of the catches from PUMPKINDEATH apply. Yeah.
* Detos Squad is watching your every move
* There are V<sub>0</sub> detos trying to find you. If you are within V<sub>0</sub> studs of one, you lose.
* Failing at all kills you, and you need to restart your entire journey. Even if you win, if you did anything sub-optimally, you die anyways and your win is undone.
* OldPlat and all the co leaders are chasing you at E<sub>0</sub> times the speed of light.
== Obstacles ==

Since this is beyond TALoO Effortful, obstacles don't exist at this level. Here are some theoretical ones, though. (Ideas from Undefinable)

*Beat the next difficulty, [[Culmination]]. (???% accurate)
*Identify a cheat code through the rest of the chart, to [[Liminal]]. (???% accurate)
== Continuing on ==
You may have bested the Detos Squad, however, there are still more extensions of this difficulty that are yet to be bested. Try going to [[Undefinable]] or [[Culmination]] and then coming back to do ''Edit Conflicting''. Or just go straight to ''Edit Conflicting'' if you feel like it.
=Edit Conflicting=

*2: 14952817488}}

== PUMPKINDEATH - VARIATION #2 ==
Thought you could escape from the spooky chain train? Too bad, you have to stay on it until we're finished! Edit Conflicting is an undefinable difficulty that is one of the first of its kind. Edit Conflicting's name comes from the fact that this page had many edit conflicts, as people were trying to publish their edits but someone else had already edited. Edit Conflicting is the most out of pocket difficulty ever to exist, because its definable obstacles have crazy themes. Most of the INVALID Obstacles are like "GO TO HAPPY MCDONALDS" or "FIND YOUR DAD", or Catches like "Say Deez Nuts (insert zalgo spam) times everytime you exist" or "SHAKULAMA 99999999999999999999999999999999999 NO ESCAPE".

Since this difficulty is beyond [[Undefinable]], obstacles that are in this difficulty could not be portrayed accurately. If they were to be described, however, they would certainly be something completely different from what we know. This is because the real obstacles in this difficulty are completely absent, as we are only left with the frivolous INVALID obstacles.

== Catches ==

*Catch the unimaginable Catch Z_9 times
*Backflip (very big number) times until the Big Bang happens again
*Your Walkspeed is -Z[Z<sub>Ω</sub>]<sub>Ω</sub>
**Same thing with Jumppower and Maxhealth
* An uncountably infinite number of people are editing this page to change it to be harder than [[The Final Difficulty]], which also changes the tower as you're playing it. You can only convince them to stop by giving all of them Z[Z<sub>Ω</sub>]<sub>Ω</sub> candy every Z[Z<sub>Ω</sub>]<sub>Ω</sub> of a planck second. They have perfect coordination, meaning there won't be any edit conflicts.

== Obstacles (INVALID) ==

*Support and Donate the K[REDACTED]n G_5 Dollars
*Hack the Channel F to play PS3^333 Graphics 
*Lol What No Gay The Heck Shut Up Fuck Hmmm (confusion obstacle)
*Nuke the "Whales" Building with a Ω TON TNT Ω times
=Spooky Dookie=
{{NewDifficultyInfobox|title1=Spooky Dookie|class=30|previous=''Israel''|next=[[Empyrean]]|image1=SpookDook.png|decal_id=14952830068}}

== PUMPKINDEATH - Variation 3 ==
Spooky Dookie is literally the worst difficulty to ever exist. No one can beat this, as it is inhumanely impossible, meaning not even the greatest of fictional concepts can surpass this difficulty.

== Icon Representation ==
The icon is a meme of a skull toilet with the caption, "Go Ahead".

== Obstacles (HIGHLY INACCURATE)==
Due to the sheer scare of the difficulty, any attempts at writing down obstacles is a futile task. Go beat Edit Conflicting like, inf times and then we'll talk.

{{NewDifficultyInfobox|title1=PUMPKINDEATH: Transcension|image1=Yesyesyes.png|class=30|previous=[[The Ultimate Construct]]|next=[[Penultimate]]|caption1=god dang bro transcended|rating=Weakly Compact Cardinal|type=* Almost-Undefinable
* Event|decal_id=14952833628}}

== PUMPKINDEATH - Variation #4 ==
Welcome to PUMPKINDEATH, but transcended. This difficulty is a transcended version of the difficulty except with the old difficulty icon and is unreal.

Difficulties of this type are almost undefinable, and are just a absolute hell.

== Obstacles ==
The problem with making obstacles at such a high level is that the difficulty is so difficult, it's getting impossible to even define obstacles. It would just be impossible to think of a obstacle of this difficulty. Because of this, we only have difficulty rushes. ''FUN, RIGHT?''

== The First Difficulty Rush ==
welcome to the first of the difficulty Rush, however you’re no-where from the end. This will be currently the difficulty of [[File:Absolute Infinity.jpg|frameless|30x30px]] [[ABSOLUTE INFINITY]]’s Low section.

Absolutely none, but if you want extremely inaccurate obstacles, here you go.

==Towers==
Naturally, due to the nature of Felix the BWAHAHHAHAHAHAH, it cannot be built. This means every tower that's this difficulty is either fictional, or unimaginably inaccurate.
== Second Difficulty Rush ==
Before going to Absolute Orange Chaos (which currently doesn't exist), you must complete this difficulty rush. This is the Difficulty of High [[File:Unbounded.jpg|frameless|30x30px]] [[Unboundable]].
