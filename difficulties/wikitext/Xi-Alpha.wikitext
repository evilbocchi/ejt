==Introduction==
[[File:Xi-Alpha Icon.png|25px]] <span id="xialpha">Xi-Alpha</span> is a difficulty after {{Class8Difficulties|DELETE}} [[DELETE]], yet before [[File:ThetaVoidRevamp.png|25px]] [[Theta-Void]]. It is located in Peak [[:Category:Class 6|Class 6]] and is the first the first difficulty of [[:Category:Mike's Difficulty Chart Chain|MrXY201’s Difficulty Chart]]. It has three sub difficulties, which they are [[File:Image (24).png|25px]] [[Gar-Terrifying]] (Gar Chain), [[File:D-E-L-T-A Revamped Icon.png|25px]] [[D-E-L-T-A]] and [[File:Ÿ revamp icon.png|25px]] [[Ÿ]]. It also used to have 2 sub difficulties, ''Xi-Beta'' and ''Xi-Delta'', both of which are gone due to being low quality.

It should not be attempted due to it requiring you to somehow surpass it without the use of TAS, unless you use noclip or even exploits. The tier system is also ineffective at this difficulty, due to it going way out of reach of the system, and the Kol Metris value is high, at around |55| (estimation).  

You should also attempt towers like the old [[Obelisk of Symbol's Difficulty Chart|Obelisk of Symbols Difficulty Chart]] (back when the difficulty was [[Everdark]]) before beating this monstrosity (despite you obviously not being able to). That is all there is to something like this.

|rowspan="2"|This icon was created by [[User:Sushislushwiki|Sushislushwiki]], and is a reimagination of this difficulty's previous icons, with some additional theming. In the center is a light blue lowercase Greek letter Xi (ξ) with a stone texture which is illuminated from top-to-bottom, a translucent blue [https://roblox.fandom.com/wiki/Respawn?file=Spawn_Decal.png Roblox respawn decal] whose opacity tapers off at the edges, and two sets of light blue glowing rings with eight concave four-pointed stars joined by eight arcs of an outlined circle, the outermost of which is much dimmer and given a [https://affinity.help/photo2/en-US.lproj/index.html?page=pages/Filters/filter_lensBlur.html&title=Lens%20Blur Lens blur] effect. The background of the icon is obsidian black ocean water with dim blue fog and blue bubbles strewn around, which also fades to a solid obsidian black at the edges of the icon. And, surrounding the icon is a glowing light blue outline that fades in opacity from top-to-bottom.

|August<br>18th, 2021
|rowspan="2"|This icon was created by [[User:HorizonOfSingularities|HorizonOfSingularities]], and is a cleaned-up version of the Original icon. The light blue lowercase Greek letter Xi (ξ) in the center is now a more saturated light blue that is now also hand-drawn. Behind the center symbol is three blue small uppercase Greek letter Xis (Ξ). And the background has been changed into a blue-to-black top-to-bottom gradient.

The icon is now surrounded by a large irregular blue pentagon-shaped blur which appears to be stacked with a slightly smaller version of itself on-top. On top of that, there are also four smaller identical copies of the center light blue lowercase Greek letter Xi (ξ) around the center.
