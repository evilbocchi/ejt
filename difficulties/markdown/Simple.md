# Simple

Simple is a very straightforward difficulty located in Bottom Class 2. Most players will have almost no trouble traveling through this difficulty. It is located between Effortless (or Playground) and Easy. This difficulty is the final sub-difficulty of Effortless as well. Since it takes up about the high spectrum of its parent difficulty, it is recommended to do beginner towers in other EToH fan games as many are around this difficulty.
