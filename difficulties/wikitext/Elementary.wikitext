==Trivia==
*[[File:Comforting (Resized).png| 30px]]  <span style="text-shadow: 0 0 4px #00ff00; color:#00ff00"><b>Elementary</b></span> used to be a sub-difficulty of [[File:PleasantfullyRemakeOhmyGAWD.png| 30px]] [[Pleasantfully|<span id="pleasantfully">Pleasantfully</span>]], [[FIle:Comfortabl.PNG| 30px]] [[User blog:Bruhshard1/Comfort|<span style="text-shadow: 0 0 4px #8f9aff; color:#8f9aff"><b>Comforting</b></span>]] and [[File:Amazing difficulty 2.PNG| 30px]] [[User blog:Bruhshard1/Encouragement|<span id="encouragement">Encouragement</span>]].<ref>The latter two are deleted.</ref>
*This is a revival of the classic {{Class1Difficulties|Easy| 30px}} [[w:c:jtoh:Easy|Easy]] sub-difficulty [[File:Nice.png|30x30px]] <span id="nice">Nice</span>, originally created by [[User:HammockIsHere|HammockIsHere]].
**Prior to its revival, it was located between [[FIle:Gar-Effortlessless.png|30x30px]] [[Gar-Effortlessless|<span id="gareffortlessless">Gar-Effortlessless</span>]] and [[File:Calm.png| 30px]] <span id="calm">[[Calm/Old Versions|Calm (Legacy)]]</span>.
*This was initially was revamped with former staff member [[User:YataDev|YataDevs]] criticisms in mind.
**After former staff member [[User:AlsoOmori|AlsoOmori]] deleted [[File:Comforting (Resized).png| 30px]] <span style="text-shadow: 0 0 4px #00ff00; color:#00ff00"><b>Elementary</b></span>, it was revamped a second time to make the article better.
**The article was eventually revamped a third time on the 21st April 2025 due to the former owners long standing dissatisfaction with the difficulty.
*This difficulties current icon was originally intended to be a resized version of [[FIle:Comfortabl.PNG| 30px]] [[User blog:Bruhshard1/Comfort|<span style="text-shadow: 0 0 4px #8f9aff; color:#8f9aff"><b>Comforting</b></span>]]'s icon as it did not render on the creators end.
**As this revamp never got moved to the mainspace, the icon was instead repurposed for [[File:Comforting (Resized).png| 30px]] <span style="text-shadow: 0 0 4px #00ff00; color:#00ff00"><b>Elementary</b></span> so that it fit better with the main EToH difficulties.
*[[File:Comforting (Resized).png| 30px]] <span style="text-shadow: 0 0 4px #00ff00; color:#00ff00"><b>Elementary</b></span> shares a name of a deleted [[File:Babying.jpg|30x30px]] [[Babying]] sub-difficulty with this icon: [[File:Без названия1 20220123211206.png|30x30px]].<ref>[[File:Enjoyable old on HelloArt edc.png|thumb]]
