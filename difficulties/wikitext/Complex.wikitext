[[File:ComplexShapedIcon.png|30px]] <span id="Complex">Complex</span> is a [[:Category:Sub-Difficulties|sub-difficulty]] located at [[w:c:jtoh:SC|Soul Crushing]] (SC) territory/Baseline [[:Category:Class 3|Class 3]] (C3 between [[File:VexatiousShapedIcon.png|30px]] <span id="Vexatious">Vexatious</span> and [[File:InsaneShapedIcon.png|link=w:c:jtoh:Insane|30px]] <span id="Insane">Insane</span>. This difficulty is also the first sub-difficulty in Baseline C3, with the following sub-difficulties being [[File:ThanosIcon.jpeg|26px|link=w:c:jtoh:Thanos_(Difficulty)]] <span id="Thanos">Thanos</span> and [[File:ClassicalHighQuality.png|26px|link=Classical]] <span id="Classical">Classical</span>. Alongside these difficulties are exclusive to the EJT Wiki, with the main difficulty of <span id="Complex">Complex</span> being [[File:VexatiousShapedIcon.png|30px]] <span id="Vexatious">Vexatious</span>. 

[[File:ComplexShapedIcon.png|30px]] <span id="Complex">Complex</span> formerly belonged to [[File:RelentlessShapedIcon.png|link=Relentless|30px]] <span id="Relentless">Relentless</span> as the last difficulty branching Regular and SC difficulties, between sub-difficulties [[File:Destruction_difficulty.png|26px|link=User blog:EpicTheGamer2014/Destruction]] <span id="Destruction">Destruction</span> and [[File:ThanosIcon.jpeg|26px|link=w:c:jtoh:Thanos_(Difficulty)]] <span id="Thanos">Thanos</span>. As well, it was originally planned to be a C8 difficulty before moving down to Peak C2, and is currently positioned at Baseline C3. However, there was another difficulty named [[File:Complex dif.PNG|26px]] <span id="ComplexOld">Complex</span> by [[User:Bruhshard1|Bruhshard1]], which was located in C5, created in 2022, and deleted the same year.

Going by the EToH difficulty chart, <span id="Complex">Complex</span> ranges from 8.05-8.09* (8.75-8.99 in EJT). Being the introduction of SC towers, there are currently a few towers that range this difficulty, being [[w:c:jtoh:TT|Thanos Tower]] (8.05), [[w:c:jtoh:Z7TR|Zone 7 Tower Rush]] (8.06), and [[w:c:jtoh:ToYAS(M)|Tower of You're A Star]] (8.08) in EToH.
