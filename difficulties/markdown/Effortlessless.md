# Effortlessless

Effortlessless is a Peak Class 1 difficulty in EET, serving as the final barrier before the EToH difficulties. It is easier than Effortless but harder than Magnificent. This is the first difficulty with actual obstacles, designed for beginners who have little to no experience with obbies. Unlike the joke difficulties below it, Effortlessless introduces real jumps and basic challenges, making it more of a "tutorial" for new players.

Most people will not find this difficulty challenging, and it is intended as a starting point for those already familiar with Roblox. Effortlessless is where new players can begin to learn the basics of obby gameplay before moving on to harder difficulties.
