# Complex

Complex is a sub-difficulty located in the Soul Crushing (SC) territory, specifically at Baseline Class 3, between Vexatious and Insane. It is the first sub-difficulty in Baseline C3 and serves as an introduction to SC towers. Complex was originally planned as a higher-class difficulty but now marks the transition from Regular to SC difficulties. It is exclusive to the EJT Wiki, with its main difficulty being Vexatious. Complex is notable for its placement and for introducing players to the challenges of SC towers.
