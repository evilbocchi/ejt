# Reflective

Reflective is an unclassified difficulty that ranges from Class Negative to Class 12, depending on the amount of reflectance present in the environment. Originally a sub-difficulty, Reflective has moved through several classifications before becoming unclassified. The challenge is determined by the reflectance value, with higher values corresponding to higher difficulty classes. Reflective is unique in that its difficulty is tied to a specific property of the environment rather than traditional obstacles.
