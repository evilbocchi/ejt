==What is Transfinite?==
[[File:Transfinite Revamp.png|frameless|50x50px]] <span style="background:linear-gradient(180deg,#00FF00,#7FFF00); -webkit-background-clip:text !important; -webkit-text-fill-color:transparent;">'''<big>Transfinite</big>'''</span> speaks itself by the incomprehensible way possible throughout for the previous difficulties. This difficulty is currently placed in the Baseline Class 7, the beginning of a new obstacle ahead. This is between [[File:Dreadful.exeoffical.png|frameless|30x30px]] [[Dreadful.exe]] and progressing further more on [[File:RoorXD.png|frameless|30x30px]] [[w:c:jtohs-hardest-towers:RoorXD|RoorXD]]. Towers or Citadels within' this difficulty should be physically impossible, every obstacle in this difficulty are highly buffed, if we suppose we're on [[File:Screen Shot 2020-08-09 at 9.36.26 PM.png|frameless|30x30px]] [[Ultra Instinct]], its far away being harder than this difficulty itself. Obstacles being in this difficulty are rarely spotted and cannot be beaten since they're mostly Impossible.

If you must know, its rating in ''[[Metris|Kol Metris]]'' would be around |550| and it is currently ranked 63 at the ''[[Extended Difficulty Chart]].''

==''Continuing from this point..''==

You've successfully beaten a Former Class finale difficulty, can't say that I'm quite surprised. At this rate, I thought, for a brief moment, that you were dead already. Now it's time to move on. Continue on [[File:RoorXD.png|frameless|30x30px]] [[w:c:jtohs-hardest-towers:RoorXD|RoorXD]], I wish you the best of luck.
