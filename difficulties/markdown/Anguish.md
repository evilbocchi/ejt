# Anguish

Anguish is a Peak Class 3 difficulty with a rating of 15. It is represented with the color black with a bright orange outline, styled after the Pit of Misery SC+ difficulties. This difficulty is supposed to represent the idea of The Forgotten Difficulties, a set of three difficulties that were placed between Unreal and nil.

Towers in this difficulty are generally convoluted with the jumps they use, as a way for making up the fact that they are almost always purist. They also generally consist of combinations of endurance tests, extreme glitch abuse and insanely precise camera and movement usage.

The feasibility of this difficulty is debated, as it is above Unreal, which has the hardest beaten tower. However, for the purposes of this wiki it will be considered a possible difficulty.

Anguish is also the second difficulty in the EToH spectrum that changes the difficulty ratings once again, because it has the exclusive rating of 15. The EToH rating that corresponds to this is (13.5 - 13.99).
