==What is '''REEE... !!!?'''==
'''REEE... !!!''' is a difficulty that is located in Class 6, ''[[:Category:Road of Pseudo Difficulties|The Road of Pseudo Difficulties]]''. It is also between  [[File:UDEADSONicon.png|frameless|30x30px]] [[U DED SON]] and [[File:Screen Shot 2020-08-13 at 1.20.05 PM.png|frameless|30x30px]] [[Nonexistent]]. Any tower in this difficulty is impossible. Nobody should be here anyways. You probably used noclip so I don't mind, but still, I am warning you. You will get annihilated by this. Your soul will get consumed. You will suffer in pain and agony. There's no point to life for you. So please, just jump into that Instant-Killbrick and die, RIGHT NOW. And besides, the main colors are always going to be blue and white. 

==Icon Representation==
'''REEE... !!!'''<nowiki/>'s icon is represented with a lot of errors on a screen as seen from the signs in [[Citadel of Impossible Victory]]. There are errors that have yellow triangles with an exclamation mark (!) on them, while the red circles have a white "X" on them, along with some chat bubbles with either the letter "i" or the "?" symbol scattered everywhere. They all represent many unique errors, and they all got their own text and names like "Exclusive!", "System Error", "Critical Error" and a lot more. (A more detailed explanation can be found [[User blog:Maxalon/REEE... !!!: Detailed Icon Explanation|here.]])
