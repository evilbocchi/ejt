# Aleph-Something

You have passed nearly 11 classes. You finally took down Denial after going through events unknown and impossible to comprehend to the average human brain. You are actually thinking you can complete this chart. But then, a new challenge in class 9 arrives.

**ALEPH-SOMETHING.**

Unless you are prepared, you aren’t gonna beat this.

Aleph-Something is the 7th difficulty of class 9, and one of the oldest in class 9. It is a difficulty after Denial, the last difficulty of the Liminality Chain, and before Omniscient, the first difficulty of the Omni Chain. Obstacles in this difficulty are inconceivable and even just building a tower of this difficulty is extremely hard. If you didn’t come prepared, then you are in for a surprise.

The last 4 classes have all been extremely challenging with their own aspects. For example: Class 6 had some difficulties with unfair obstacles, like Everdark where you cannot see anything due to the darkness, El Vacio, where you have to find a way to do a jump without attempting it, MegaDeath, where you put all your skills to the test thus far, and much more. All of this will end right here, right now.
