== What is <span style="color:#9691ff">'''Horrific'''</span>? ==
<span style="color:#9691ff">'''Horrific'''</span> is a difficulty represented by a lilac color (#9691FF) with a black square. It contains obstacles harder than '''[[Catastrophic|<span style="color:#fff">Catastrophic</span>]]''', but below '''[[Unreal|<span style="color:#4B00C8">Unreal</span>]]''' within the difficulty chart. This used to be an official difficulty in JToH so people wouldn't make '''[[nil|<span style="color:#5e5e62">nil</span>]]''' towers, but later got removed. Anybody attempting towers at this difficulty must have great precision and even so will stand a slight chance at completing something of this difficulty. 

==In Eternal '''Towers of Hell'''==
<span style="color:#9691ff">'''Horrific'''</span> used to be a split difficulty from '''[[Catastrophic|<span style="color:#fff">Catastrophic</span>]]''' between '''[[nil|<span style="color:#5e5e62">nil</span>]]''' and the latter, and was once official in EToH. However, the difficulty was removed since the difficulty was redundant according to ''Jukecallaa''. According to ''Gammattor'', if five victors arise from the hell that is <span style="color:#9691ff">'''Horrific'''</span>, it would have been re-added with a more threatening name. It had been re-added in the Pit of Misery non-canon subrealm in Zone 3 but a few years later that subrealm was removed along with the difficulties. The difficulty now being used in The Eternal Abyss (the official sequal to Pit of Misery), a game owned by bLockerman666.

Good job! We know this is possible because BoomSasok has beaten [[Tower of Vacant Hindrances|ToVH]] fully legit, making him the first person to beat a <span style="color:#9691ff">'''Horrific'''</span> tower. Anyway, you may want to try '''[[Unreal|<span style="color:#4B00C8">Unreal</span>]]''' difficulty towers next.
