==What is <span style="color:#770000;text-shadow:0 2px 5px #430000, 0 -2px 5px #430000;font-family:Arial Black">Detroit?</span>==
[[File:Detroit-XPELO4EK-REVAMP.png|30x30px]] <span style="color:#770000;text-shadow:0 2px 5px #430000, 0 -2px 5px #430000;font-family:Arial Black">[[Detroit]]</span> is a Mid Class 8 difficulty succeeding [[File:Sandbox.png|30x30px]] [[User:EndJJT/Sandbox|Sandbox]], and preceding [[File:Sacrificingly-Impossible W effects.jpg|frameless|30x30px]] [[Sacrificingly Impossible]]. Now, obviously, you must be prepared for this difficulty, because this is gonna be [[Nullifying|nullifyingly]] difficult. And if you were wondering where you just got teleported, let [[Detroit]] itself explain. I know, just another cringey sentient difficulty, again, but you'll get the idea of it.

But before that, let's explain this difficulty a little more.

[[File:Detroit-XPELO4EK-REVAMP.png|30x30px]] <span style="color:#770000;text-shadow:0 2px 5px #430000, 0 -2px 5px #430000;font-family:Arial Black">Detroit</span> has a rating of 83.5, and even though a ~0.18 rating difference looks small to the normal eye, this difference is very strong for Class 8. This difficulty requires a wide-ranged understanding of glitches that don't, and shouldn't exist, and a level of skill that literally nobody but you has achieved, plus multiple months, or even years of agonizing practice. Pretty small requirements, right? 

Again, this difficulty is very hard, but it's only an 11 stud difference from Peripheral [[File:Sandbox.png|30x30px]] [[User:EndJJT/Sandbox|Sandbox]], so you should be, well, relatively fine doing this.

But again, that's 11 studs! Just imagine going from 0 stud jumps, all the way to 11 studs. That's like [[Climb A Truss]] to [[C0RrUpT]]! And a 1 class difference in class 1 converted to class 8 is 1 DIFFICULTY. Actually, sorry, one SECTION. Even conquering 1 jump of this difficulty is borderline insane, so imagine beating an entire tower of this difficulty. There will be tons of difficult things to complete, but I assure you, you WILL beat this someday. You've already completed so many difficulties, like Insane, Nil or even [[File:Sandbox.png|frameless|30x30px]] [[User:EndJJT/Sandbox|Sandbox]]! And there were, well, a few inaccurate difficulties that you've had to estimate yourself, and beat, like [[File:Everdark.png|frameless|30x30px]] [[Everdark]] (that's supposed to say Decimation, idk what happened) , which at the time of writing this, has Class 9 (or currently 7) obstacles. Not pointing fingers at anyone, but still. Keep going, soldier. 

Update: Decimation has now been rebalanced to fit Class 5 (previously 6). 
==Lore==
Hello, fellow obbyist. I see that you are on your journey to [[The Crystal Core]], [[The Middleline]], [[Pinnacle]], [[Vigorous]] and [[Theoretical]], [[THE BORDERLINE]], [[Destroiny]], and all legendaries, fabled difficulties, and primordials ahead. Anyway, your memories were erased after you beat the [[User:EndJJT/Sandbox|Sandbox]] floor, so I'll explain. once you completed that floor, you screen froze for 5 hours, and you just did some really dumb stuff, like trying to make 2=2 false, and finally got some girls while being split in half and one half being in Beijing, and your other half being on Wasp-12b. After the 5 hours ended, your entire house, and you somehow got teleported to Detroit. You went back to your room, and suddenly you didn't remember those 5 hours. Then, you looked at your screen and saw that you were on a new floor. The sign said the words "You have arrived in [[True Hell]]. (don't worry, you're not in Class 30.) Don't even try. If you do, you get sent to Rebirth [[Effortful]]." '''''Your run has begun.'''''

==Icon Representation==

This image has a few differences, and I'll sum them all up right here. The stock market graph is now lower quality, the text is more visible, the gradients are gone, the image now has a border and the V_V is lower quality and not glowing anymore.}}

==Obstacles==
'''WARNING:''' Wallhop obstacles are ESTIMATED.


Catches:

*Everything is off by a small margin of error, so a 793 stud jump could be 794, 793 or even 789 in rare cases, and by everything, I mean everything, like the floor size, the amount of floors, everything. So, for you, Peripheral could be harder or easier than listed here. And 793 could actually be 793.04, or like 792.987 or something.
*There is no winpad, because you can't have winpads in Detroit.
*You can't have a good tower frame in Detroit, which is why every tower of this difficulty looks abhorrent. So. look at Exhibit A. [[File:ToSG.webp|frameless|60x60px]] <- ''Exhibit A''

== Trivia ==

* This difficulty was meant to be Class 12, which would've been right in the middle of [[File:Destroineasy.png|frameless|30x30px]]''Unrebirth Destroiny'' and [[File:Destroiny.png|frameless|40x40px]][[Destroiny]].
* This difficulty was submitted because [[User:Xpelo4ek|Xpelo4ek]] made a joke that I should put it on the wiki.
* This difficulty actually has 5 icons, not 3.
* This difficulty has custom tower hints for every tower, and one of them is "Can't even beat this in [[Detroit]]."
* This difficulty got a revamp on May 30th, 2024, but it got scrapped. The revamp is in its submission page, but may be moved somewhere else soon.

==Moving On==
As expected, you passed. I guess just go onto [[File:Sacrificingly-Impossible W effects.jpg|30x30px]] [[Sacrificingly Impossible]].
