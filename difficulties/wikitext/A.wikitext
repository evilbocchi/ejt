==What is <span style="color:red">'''A'''</span>?==
<span style="color:red">'''A'''</span> is a Mid [[:Category:Class Negative|Class Negative]] difficulty, which lays in between [[File:True Ease (New).webp|30x30px]] [[True Ease]] and  [[File:Square Felix The AA.png|frameless|30x30px]] [[Felix the ДА]]. This difficulty is so easy that you don't even need to have to exist, which means you have beaten this in every timeline. It is the absolute antipode of [[File:Deadly Tubular Death Icon.gif|30x30px]] [[DEADLY TUBULAR DEATH]], which in conclusion means that '''<u>you cannot lose any possible way.</u>''' 

The only thing stopping you is if you manage to make its catches abide by your rules so that it does not apply towards you. Note that you absolutely cannot build or script a floor of this difficulty. Again, this means you can just skip the difficulty or add teleporters which teleports you at blazing-fast speed.

==Icon Representation==
<span style="color:red">'''A'''</span>'s icon is represented by a cross and sickle on a red background, representing christian communism. It's not a hammer and sickle because otherwise roblox and youtube will get mad at you. There's some variations of it.

Well, there is also a hammer and sickle variant, but I wouldn’t recommend using it.

==Trivia==

*This difficulty is '''Classic''', in fact, around ten of the Class Negative difficulties are classic.
* This used to be called Unrebirth Communism but was changed for an unknown reason. 
**It was a vandalism that took off, a funny way to name it, Communism was temporarily deleted, and it was to start a chain (which it ended up doing!) 
***This is why the icon looks like what it is, <s>and failing this difficulty is about as hard as beating [[COMMUNISM]], which is the antipode of this difficulty.</s>
****This is now false since this now the antipode of [[File:Deadly Tubular Death Icon.gif|30x30px]] [[DEADLY TUBULAR DEATH]].
*The is part of the Letter chain, not the one in the JTE.
