# Nought

Nought is a High Class 5 difficulty, positioned after Ultimate and before System Error. At this stage, physical possibility is almost entirely theoretical, with obstacles requiring inhuman luck, precision, and timing. Even the most skilled players struggle with this difficulty, as it is classified as TAS Impossible. Nought represents a significant leap in challenge, pushing the boundaries of what is considered possible.
