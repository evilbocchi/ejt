# Heart Of Void

The Heart Of Void is a Baseline Class 4 humanly impossible sub-difficulty. It is harder than nil or Jank but easier than eRRoR. Obstacles in this difficulty require near-perfect precision and skill, making towers of this difficulty not recommended without the use of items.

This difficulty used to be the transition point between nil and eRRoR, but newer difficulties have since taken that position. It is a sub-difficulty of eRRoR and originated from OoIDC.
