'''QR Code''' is a High [[:Category:Class 8|Class 8]] difficulty made by [[User:TasmanianRex|TasmanianRex]]. It consists of one sub difficulty, {{Class12Difficulties|Bar Code}} [[User blog:EpicTheGamer2014/Bar Code|Bar Code]] which is a sequel to this difficulty. This difficulty is the first difficulty made by TasmanianRex, with a humorous origin dating back in 2021. The icon represents your typical everyday QR Code. Obstacles in this difficulty are impossible to build in sandboxes, when there is a space limit (i.e Obby Creator). It was created on 29 July 2021.

==Variants==
Over the course of history, this difficulty has two variations, Bar Code and {{Class12Difficulties|Low Quality QR Code|20px}} [[User:TasmanianRex/LQQRC: Legacy|Low Quality QR Code]]. Bar Code is a sequel to this difficulty, originally meant to be an independent difficulty located in Baseline [[:Category:Class 15|Class 15]]. LQQRC is a follow up from Bar Code when the Low Budget Chain was relevant. It was deleted due to personal reasons and later archived in a subpage of User:TasmanianRex.

==Icon Implementation==
Implementing the icon of this difficulty is generally not recommended, as this is a potential violation of Roblox's Terms of Service if you added an external link outside of Roblox (except YouTube, Facebook, Discord, Twitter and Twitch). You also have to comply with your jurisdiction in your region as well as the Terms of Services in other websites. Moreover, you cannot circumvent Roblox's monitors by using a bypass. Thus, ether you have to substitute with a filter icon (ex. [Insert QR Code here]) or replicate the icon on Roblox Studio (which is subjected to moderation on Roblox). If you have the risk, you can ether use the original video found in this icon or use a different link. The safest option is to use what the QR code shown in this difficulty takes you to, even though it’s a rickroll. Here are the methods listed in this article:

!Method Name
!Description
|-
|[[File:qrmethod1.png|50px]]
|Filter Image
| This is one of the easiest method you can replicate. Not only you can create the icon with little to no effort, you also avoiding the risk of Roblox Moderation (unless it looks like a QR Code).
|-
|[[File:qrmethod2.png|50px]]
|Hand-Made Image
| By carefully building by using the icon as a reference, you can create a perfect looking icon. However, it may contain inaccuracies and subjected to moderation on Roblox.
|-
|[[File:qrmethod3.png|50px]]
|Freshly Uploaded Image
| This is the most dangerous method with highest rewards, as this is involving uploading a QR Code and waiting for moderation review process. If your image is flagged as a violation of Roblox's ToS, you will punished by warning or ban if continued with pre-existing offences.
|-
|[[File:qrmethod4.png|50px]]
|Model/Decal Bypass
|By bypassing the moderation process, you can exactly upload the icon into Roblox by unconventional means. For example, [https://www.roblox.com/library/7423058726/ this model] was uploaded into Roblox by using a patched model bypass method. The linked model is NOT the ultimate solution to the icon implementation problem.
