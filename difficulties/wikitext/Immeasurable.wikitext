==What is <span style="color:#5c2525; text-shadow:0 0 4px #000">'''Immeasurable'''</span>'''?'''==
<span style="color:#5c2525; text-shadow:0 0 4px #000">'''Immeasurable'''</span> is a difficulty assigned to towers harder than '''[[Aleph-Null]]''' but easier than '''[[Malicious]]'''. It is represented with the color black with a maroon "¿¿¿" on it. This is the second-hardest difficulty in the entire wiki. Obstacles of this difficulty are nearly impossible to make and require mastery of multiple techniques, luck, and inhumanity. Towers with <span style="color:#5c2525; text-shadow:0 0 4px #000">'''Immeasurable'''</span> difficulty are obviously impossible for any human to perform, and will never, ever, be beaten.

==Towers in this difficulty==

* ToCL - [[Tower of Creepy Limbo]] (Peak Immeasurable)

==Trivia==
*This difficulty is made by [https://www.roblox.com/users/1710070/profile Bob_9001].

==Continuing from this point==
Good job. You somehow made it past a difficulty that you physically can't beat; you probably used TAS. Anyway, if you for some reason want to continue, attempt [[Malicious]] next. That's the absolute limit [[RoorXD|before...]]
