# Nonexistent

Nonexistent is a Low Class 6 difficulty in the second-to-last road of pseudo difficulties. It is unbearably hard, requiring extensive practice and skill. Nonexistent is known for its abundance of wallhops, gaps, and killbricks, making it both skill-based and reliant on luck.

This difficulty is a significant step up from previous challenges and is not recommended for the faint of heart.
