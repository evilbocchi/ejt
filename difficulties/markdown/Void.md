Void is a Devilish Difficulty incorporated in Peak Class 7, placed in between Infinity & its successor Doog. This difficulty is physically impossible or basically just impossible in simpler terms.

Obstacles of this difficulty are highly complex & janky. However, it is completely pitch-black on your screen, hence its name Void. Which means the difficulty requires inhuman and rough memorization as well. It is speculated that it is TAS-Impossible.
