== What is <span style="color:#99d1e5;text">Do Nothing</span>?==
<span style="color:#99d1e5;text">'''Do Nothing'''</span> is a Class 0 difficulty that succeeds [[File:Winsome.png|30x30px]] [[Winsome]], but preceeds [[File:Sleepful2.png|30px]] [[Sleepful]]. As the name says, you'd do absolutely nothing, Not even breathe and you some how still manage to win. This difficulty is pretty quick, and even if you look away or blink slightly, you'd miss it, at least on the lower parts.

== Icon representation ==
<span style="color:#99d1e5;text">Do Nothing's</span> icon consists of a white question mark (?) in the middle of a pastel-blue background. Pretty simple for JJT, right? The background color is Sky Blue (#99D1E5), and the question mark color is White (#FFFFFF).
