# Satan Tartarus Lucifer Void

Satan Tartarus Lucifer Void (STLV) is a Class 8 normal difficulty that succeeds COMMUNISM and precedes QR Code. It is divided into four sections—Satan, Tartarus, Lucifer, and Void—each representing a different aspect of the challenge. The difficulty has been intentionally nerfed by its creators to make it just barely attemptable, but it remains impossible in every way. STLV was once the end of Class 11 and is designed to be a torturous, hellish experience that tests the limits of any player who dares to attempt it.
