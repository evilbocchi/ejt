# Prodigious

Prodigious is a soul-crushing difficulty made by IPeedMyPants, with a black color and blue outline. It is placed in the Peak spectrum of Class 3, between Reversed and Anguish. Obstacles require skills far beyond the average player, and failing a single jump means losing all progress. Attempting this difficulty demands experience, time, and sometimes special tools.
