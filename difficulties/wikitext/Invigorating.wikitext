==Introduction -  [[File:Invigorating.jpg|50x50px]] <span style="background:linear-gradient(black, #830900); -webkit-background-clip:text !important; -webkit-text-fill-color:transparent;"><big>[[Invigorating]]</big></span> ==
'''[[File:Invigorating.jpg|30x30px]]''' <span style="background:linear-gradient(black, #830900); -webkit-background-clip:text !important; -webkit-text-fill-color:transparent;">[[Invigorating]]</span> is located in class 5, lying after [[File:New epsilon .PNG|30x30px]] [[Hellicious]], yet preceding [[File:Apocalyptic.png|30x30px]] [[Apocalyptic]]. In addition, this difficulty is classified as a "TAS impossible" difficulty, having a rating of 34 on the alternate difficulty chart.                                                                                                                 

Although it is located in the first quarter of the alternate difficulty chart, it is still uncompletable by humans normally. In fact, it is even impossible to complete using Tool Assisted Speedruns, due to its placement in the difficulty chart. As a result, it is fruitless to attempt to complete a difficulty at this level, or any difficulty above [[File:Invigorating.jpg|30x30px]] <span style="background:linear-gradient(black, #830900); -webkit-background-clip:text !important; -webkit-text-fill-color:transparent;">[[Invigorating]]</span>.

An average tower in this difficulty would feature a variety of mechanics, various glitches, difficult purist sections, and confusing puzzles. Obstacles in '''[[File:Invigorating.jpg|30x30px]]''' <span style="background:linear-gradient(black, #830900); -webkit-background-clip:text !important; -webkit-text-fill-color:transparent;">[[Invigorating]]</span> are often long and punishing, taking an incredible amount of precision, timing, and luck to recreate.

As a result, one attempting this difficulty would be recommended to use tools such as blessed coils, vertical mobility, and god mode to complete if he or she wanted to actually complete the difficulty, due to the excessive uses of instakills and the incredibly arduous obstacles.

The origin of the name "[[File:Invigorating.jpg|30x30px]] <span style="background:linear-gradient(black, #830900); -webkit-background-clip:text !important; -webkit-text-fill-color:transparent;">[[Invigorating]]</span>" comes from the word invigorating, which means making one feel strong, healthy, and full of energy. This may have to do with the fact that this difficulty requires a ton of strength and energy to require.

It is also incredibly punishing. Many obstacles will have immense amounts of instakills, which will most certainly respawn one attempting a tower in this difficulty. There will also be many parts where it is easy to lose progress; in fact, it is likely that if one fails on any section of the difficulty, he or she would be compelled to restart the totality of the tower or obby.

As previously mentioned, this difficulty has a rating of 34, as it is in between [[File:New epsilon .PNG|30x30px]] [[Hellicious]]<nowiki/>and [[File:Apocalyptic.png|30x30px]] [[Apocalyptic]]. Additionally, [[File:Invigorating.jpg|30x30px]] <span style="background:linear-gradient(black, #830900); -webkit-background-clip:text !important; -webkit-text-fill-color:transparent;">[[Invigorating]]</span> would have a tier rating of ~37, and alternatively, it would have a Kol Metris rating of around |~450|.

*If a player stops moving for any longer than 1 second, they will take 20 damage. You also can’t regenerate health. If the player runs out of health, they will get sent back [[Aleph-Null]], and if it happens 5 times, they will start getting sent back to [[w:c:jtohs-hardest-towers:Why|Why]].
* Everything is moving incredibly quickly, and if you miss the obstacles, you will be sent back to [[File:Noxious.png|30x30px]] [[Noxious]]
*No items work when trying to beat this legitimately, they only work in practice mode. This includes TAS! The only exception is shift lock, of course.

==Continuing from this point -  [[File:Invigorating.jpg|50x50px]] <span style="background:linear-gradient(black, #830900); -webkit-background-clip:text !important; -webkit-text-fill-color:transparent;"><big>[[Invigorating]]</big></span>==
It is quite unlikely and downright impossible one could somehow complete a difficulty at this magnitude, but if he or she in fact did, it would be advised to continue onto [[File:Apocalyptic.png|30x30px]] [[Apocalyptic]], the next difficulty.
