# Rush

Rush is a Class 9 physically impossible difficulty that comes before Aleph-VSC and after The Crystal Core. The defining feature of Rush is its strict time limitsâ€”every obstacle is timed for optimal completion, requiring players to speedrun with near-perfect precision. Even without the time constraints, the obstacles themselves are impossible for humans or TAS to complete. Rush is a high-stakes, high-speed challenge that tests both skill and luck to the extreme.
