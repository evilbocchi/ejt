# DEATH

DEATH is a difficulty assigned to towers that are harder than No and easier than HELL. Represented by a red skull on a black background with a red outline, towers in this difficulty are humanly impossible. DEATH stands as a daunting challenge, with obstacles that push beyond the limits of human capability.
