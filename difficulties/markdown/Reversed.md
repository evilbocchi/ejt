# Reversed

Reversed is a Class 3 sub-difficulty that introduces a unique twist: all controls and visuals are reversed, and the player appears upside-down with inverted colors. After beating Horrific, players find themselves in this disorienting world, where moving left turns you right and everything feels backwards. The challenge lies not just in the obstacles, but in adapting to the reversed controls and perspective. Mastery of Reversed requires practice and a willingness to embrace confusion before moving on to even greater challenges.
