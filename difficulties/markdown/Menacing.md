Menacing is a Class 2 difficulty directly between Difficult and Challenging. This is where things start to get properly complicated: 1-stud platforms become common, longer jumps (7-8 studs) appear more often, and wraparounds of 5-7 studs are generally found. Sometimes glitches may be used. Overall, this difficulty is still fairly easy to beat with patience and some skill, but it marks a step up in complexity.
