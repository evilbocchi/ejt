# Phi

Phi is a Class 6 Sub-Difficulty of the legendary difficulty Supreme. It succeeds Supreme and is far more tedious, serving as a precursor to UNTHINKABLE. Obstacles in Phi are barely physically impossible and cannot be beaten without exploits, requiring extreme precision and unfathomable amounts of RNG. Even completing a single jump at this level is a remarkable accomplishment, making Phi truly, unobjectively impossible.
