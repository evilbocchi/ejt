It surpasses the strenuous {{Class2Difficulties|Intense}} [[w:c:jtoh:Intense|Intense]], and preceding the onerous {{Class2Difficulties|Remorseless}} [[w:c:jtoh:Remorseless|Remorseless]]. This difficulty is one of many that have tried to be the border between Intense and Remorseless.

[[File:Severe2.png|30x30px]] <span style="color:#cc99ff">'''Severe'''</span> acts and looks like like a fanmade JToH difficulty, projecting obstacles too hard to be Intense, yet too sub-standard to be Remorseless either. Around this point, we are at the beginning of JToH’s second, more impossible half, and as such you must be committed at obbies to surpass this, and completing this is deemed quite the achievement.

==Trivia==
*The color was originally just going to be the exact middle between Intense and Remorseless, but [[User blog:EpicTheGamer2014/Unforgiving|Unforgiving]] had that color already. Thus, the creator just made the color dimmer.

*This difficulty originally had a LOT of towers during development.
**Most of them were picked from Peak Intense to Bottom Remorseless towers, however.
***The creator sadly lost the revision though, as it refreshed before he could save it. Therefore, there’s less towers than there would be.
==Continuing on from this point==
You’ve completed [[File:Severe2.png|30x30px]] <span style="color:#cc99ff">'''Severe'''</span>. You must’ve had severe rage while doing this. Now, you have 2 choices, either move onto {{Class2Difficulties|Remorseless}} [[w:c:jtoh:Remorseless|Remorseless]], or just.
