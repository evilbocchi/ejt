# Treacherous

Treacherous is a Class 3 "Borderline Impossible" difficulty, positioned between Unreal and Anguish. It is extremely hard, to the point where only a select few will emerge victorious. Treacherous is considered the first final challenge before entering the realm of human impossibility.

The icon is a dark purple background, representing the transition from Unreal to Nil. Towers in this difficulty are known for their high level of challenge and are a true test of skill for any player.
