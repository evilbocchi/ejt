# Reality

Reality is a Class 4 difficulty designed to be a significant challenge, harder than Aleph-Null and Mystical but easier than Immeasurable. The environment is dark and foreboding, with obstacles that are extremely difficult to locate and overcome. The difficulty is meant to be a major roadblock, testing the player's ability to adapt and persevere in a harsh, unforgiving setting.
