==Introduction==
[[File:Pleasant.png|frameless|30x30px]] '''Pleasant''' is a ''Class 1'' Difficulty, being very well known, due to it originating from JET. As such, you will see this difficulty crop up in most DC towers, and even fangames as well. This is the last official difficulty of Class 1. You barely need to do anything here, it’s that easy. It is also beyond {{Class0Difficulties|Flowerness New}} [[Flowerness]] but before {{Class0Difficulties|Tutorial}} [[Tutorial]]. However, it is after {{Class0Difficulties|A Difficulty Named Difficulty}} [[A Difficulty Named Difficulty]], but before {{Class0Difficulties|Piece o' Cake}} [[Piece o' Cake]] if we count sub. By the way, it also precede another easy <span class = "spoilerblur" style = "color:#00FF00">fakeout</span> difficulty, [[File:New Eternified Partyness.png|30px]] [[Eternified Partyness]]!

Obstacles in this difficulty are very, very basic, due to the fact that client objects could over-inflate the difficulty, leading to the placement being inaccurate. 

== Icon Representation ==
<tabber>
|-|Current Icon=
<center>[[File:Pleasant.png|60x60px]]</center>
It is a light cyan icon, with a white pixelated =3 emoticon.
|-|Bluer=
<center>[[File:BluerPleasant.png|60x60px]]</center>
A bluer version of the current icon, with the emoticon being bigger as well. This icon is used as the default for the difficulty's page on JET.
|-|Alternate=
<center>[[File:Oldpleasant.png|60x60px]]</center>
A remade version of the icon, featuring stars on the top left and bottom right corners. This version of the icon was made and used as the official icon when [[User:Viranenthusiast|Viranenthusiast]] owned the difficulty.
|-|Alternate (2)=
<center>[[File:PleasantAstrominalRemake.png|60x60px]]</center>
A pixelated version of the alternate icon, with only a singular star at the top right corner instead of what the previous icon had. This icon was made by [[User:Astrominal|Astrominal]] after multiple complaints about the then-official icon not being pixelated. This version of the icon is now used as its icon for [[The Remake Project]]

==Trivia==
*This difficulty is found in so many places, we physically can’t count them all.
**It even appeared in some people blog posts, difficulty names and even difficulty chart towers too! (just can't tell examples yet)
*The only reason this difficulty is on EJT is because it was thought that the JET wiki was going to be closed (it wasn't)

== Other Wikis This Difficulty Is On ==
