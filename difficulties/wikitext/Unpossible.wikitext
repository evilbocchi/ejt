==What Is [[File:Rebirth Unimpossible.png|frameless|31x31px]] '''Unpossible'''?==
A variation of a [[:Category:Class Negative|Class Negative]] Difficulty - [[Unimpossible]] - is called [[File:Rebirth Unimpossible.png|30px]] '''Unpossible'''. This version has been buffed one hundred billion times or more. If the original version of [[Unimpossible]] is [[Instant Win]], this one is Instant Death. Most things about this difficulty are impossible, including humanly impossible, TAS impossible, physically impossible, and more. To even just get past the first barrier, you need an inexplicable amount of luck and skill. As a result, only hackers can circumvent this.

The difficulty is a successor to [[File:El Vacio Sqaure.png|30x30px]] [[El Vacio]] and a predecessor to [[File:UniverseDisruptionSquare.png|30x30px]] [[Universe Disruption]]. It was a part of the Class 9 rebirth chain, but everything else got deleted and this is the last piece of it. <br />

==Trivia==   

*This is currently the easiest rebirth difficulty, although there was going to be a ''Rebirth Ifinity''.
**However, this is no longer a rebirth difficulty due to chart changes once it was revived.
*This page has received a revamp on the 15th of August, adding more information, making obstacles more accurate, and making the page much better.   
** It also had an icon, although the old rebirth Unimpossible icon is now double rebirth Unimpossible, and the double rebirth Unimpossible icon is now the triple rebirth icon.
*This page has been deleted thrice due to unknown reasons.
