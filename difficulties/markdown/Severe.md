# Severe

Severe is a Peak Class 2, Normal Difficulty, represented with a pale, dim purple color. It surpasses the strenuous Intense and precedes the onerous Remorseless. This difficulty is one of many that have tried to be the border between Intense and Remorseless.

Severe acts and looks like a fanmade JToH difficulty, projecting obstacles too hard to be Intense, yet too sub-standard to be Remorseless. Around this point, you are at the beginning of JToHâ€™s second, more impossible half, and completing this is deemed quite the achievement.
