{{Header|Trivia}}
* This is the second event difficulty to be added to EToH, the first being [[Epic|<span id="Epic">'''Epic'''</span>]]. and the third being '''[[Sisyphean|<span style="color:#969664;">Sisyphean</span>]]'''.
**'''Epic''' and '''Sisyphean''' were also added in an April Fools event.
* The only tower in this difficulty is impossible, as attempting to enter it will kick the player immediately.
** However, by completing a series of quests stemming from the [[Laruam Backrooms]], you will be able to access it.
* This joke difficulty is likely meant to mock fanmade difficulties that are above [[nil|<span id="nil">'''nil'''</span>]].
