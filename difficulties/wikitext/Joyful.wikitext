== Overview ==
'''Joyful''' is a [[:Category:Class 1|Class 1]] difficulty created for the [https://jtohs-easiest-towers.fandom.com/wiki/JToH%27s_easiest_towers_Wiki JET] Chain. It is a difficulty between {{Class0Difficulties|Automatic|20px}} [[Automatic]] and [[File:Press a Key.png|20x20px]] [[Press a Key]] (or [[Placid]]). This difficulty also only has one sub difficulty: {{Class0Difficulties|Do Something|20px}} [[Do Something]].

Obstacles in this difficulty only requires a single in-game action to complete. The rest of the obstacles in '''Joyful''' are similar to {{Class0Difficulties|Automatic|20px}} [[Automatic]]. Joyful USED to contain really slow and boring conveyers as well to the point where you'll just do multiple actions instead, but I guess it's gone now.

Like other [[:Category:Class 1|Class 1]] difficulties, this difficulty is almost never a challenge to the player. It is recommended that you skip these time-wasting difficulties and move on to attempting something similar in difficulty like [https://jtoh.fandom.com/wiki/Tower_of_Annoyingly_Simple_Trials Tower of Annoyingly Simple Trials] instead.

== Obstacles ==
In this difficulty, the player only has to do a single in-game action, usually by pressing the spacebar to jump. Not only do you have to press the spacebar in order to complete this difficulty, you can also ''Tap a Key'' similar to {{Class0Difficulties|Do Something|20px}} [[Do Something]]. The rule of thumb for creating a tower in this difficulty is that you cannot build more than one obstacle. Based on the explanation given on this section, building a '''Joyful''' difficulty tower is simple and not time consuming.

In Difficulty Chart Towers, '''Joyful''' in difficulty charts by making the whole floor Automatic until the last part of it, where you have to jump to proceed to the next difficulty/sub-difficulty. The definitions have changed in the years and as more useless difficulties piled onto the chart, this is the first action the player needs to do.

== Trivia ==
* This difficulty alongside other [https://jtohs-easiest-towers.fandom.com/wiki/JToH%27s_easiest_towers_Wiki JET] difficulties were transferred to JJT due to the potential closure of [https://jtohs-easiest-towers.fandom.com/wiki/JToH%27s_easiest_towers_Wiki JET] wiki.
* GNZT used to use the original [[Obelisk of Impossible Difficulty Chart|OoIDC]] icon in-game, but it was change to a modern-day icon as seen in [[Obelisk of Endless Difficulty Amplifying|OoEDA]].
