==What is [[File:Playgrounddif.png|30px]] <span style="color:#00e800">'''Playground'''</span>?==
[[File:Playgrounddif.png|30px]] <span style="color:#00e800">'''Playground'''</span> is a [[:Category:Class 2|baseline class 2]] official [[:Category:Sub-Difficulties|sub-difficulty]] of {{Class1Difficulties|Effortless}} [[w:c:jtoh:Effortless|Effortless]]. It follows its main difficulty, {{Class1Difficulties|Effortless}} [[w:c:jtoh:Effortless|Effortless]], but precedes {{Class1Difficulties|Effortless}} [[w:c:jtoh:Effortless|Effortless]]'s other subdifficulty, [[File:Comforting.png|link=Elementary|30x30px]] [[Elementary]], and other main difficulties like {{Class1Difficulties|Easy}} [[w:c:jtoh:Easy|Easy]]. Given that it's a lower-end class 2 difficulty, it should be fairly easy and fun to complete for the average obbyist, even with needing more effort than {{Class1Difficulties|Effortless}} [[w:c:jtoh:Effortless|Effortless]].
==Icon Representation==
{{IconRepresentationAlternate|image=[[File:Playgrounddif.png|50px]]|color=#00e800|description=The icon is just one solid {{colorbox|#00e800}} greenish color named [https://colornames.org/color/00e800 Spacey Emeralds].

==Trivia==
*This page was previously deleted and revived three separate times.
*This difficulty replaced {{Class1Difficulties|Simple}} [[Simple]] as the official sub of {{Class1Difficulties|Effortless}} [[w:c:jtoh:Effortless|Effortless]].
**This is now outdated as both {{Class1Difficulties|Simple}} [[Simple]] and [[File:Comforting.png|link=Elementary|30x30px]] [[Elementary]] are back on the chart.
*This was the only official {{Class1Difficulties|Effortless}} [[w:c:jtoh:Effortless|Effortless]] sub-difficulty, before the official difficulty chart got abandoned.
*This page was revamped twice.

==Continuing from this point==
Good job. You've beaten the only official {{Class1Difficulties|Effortless}} [[w:c:jtoh:Effortless|Effortless]] sub-difficulty. If you want to do the other {{Class1Difficulties|Effortless}} [[w:c:jtoh:Effortless|Effortless]] sub-difficulty, try [[File:Comforting.png|link=Elementary|30x30px]] [[Elementary]]. If you want to skip sub-difficulties and continue with the official JToH difficulties, attempt {{Class1Difficulties|Easy}} [[w:c:jtoh:Easy|Easy]]. Either way, good luck on your journey and have fun.{{MainDifficultiesNavbox}}[[Category:Difficulties]][[Category:Sub-Difficulties]][[Category:Class 2]][[Category:One color icon]][[Category:Revamped Difficulty]]
