# LOOP

LOOP is a difficulty considered to be the most lengthy on the entire difficulty chart. It involves a massive, monolithic tower crossing that includes every other tower, steeple, citadel, obelisk, and even tower rush, making it much longer and more challenging than any other difficulty. Gameplay in this difficulty can take hundreds of hours, as it combines the total difficulty of all these towers into one, resulting in a Class 9 rating.

The unique aspect of LOOP is its paradox: as more towers are combined, the difficulty and length multiply, but due to huge gaps between the hardest towers, it remains at Class 9. If not for these gaps, LOOP would surpass all other difficulties. It is known for being the longest, most varied, and potentially the hardest difficulty, with countless types of obstacles and challenges.
