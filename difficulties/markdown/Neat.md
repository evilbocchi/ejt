# Neat

Neat is a sub-difficulty of Baseline Class 2 (C2), positioned between Easy and Calm, with a difficulty rating between 1.25 and 1.49. Originally created for the mini-tower Not Even A Tower (NEAT) in Eternal Towers of Hell, it was later adjusted due to balance changes.

Neat is known for its approachable challenge and was created by Dreadful.exe, with later revamps by other contributors. Despite its playful theming, it is not considered a joke difficulty.
