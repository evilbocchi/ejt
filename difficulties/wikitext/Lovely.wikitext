This is one of the easiest difficulties that require effort. If you have a basic understanding of the mechanic of walking in Roblox, you should be pretty capable of beating this.

==Continuing From This Point==
I'm sure you're probably VERY bored right now, Player. I promise it will become more exciting soon, but for now, move on to [[File:Pleasant.png|frameless|30x30px]] [[Pleasant]] (or [[File:Glee Difficulty.png|frameless|31x31px]] [[Glee]], or [[File:New flowerness image1.png|frameless|30x30px]] [[Flowerness]], or its [[Coasterifying|sub-]][[A Difficulty Named Difficulty|difficulties]]...). Or you can just go to [[File:Effortless difficulty.png|frameless|30x30px]] [[w:c:jtoh:Effortless|Effortless]] or [[File:EasyDifficulty.jpg|frameless|30x30px]] [[w:c:jtoh:Easy|Easy]]. Good luck, and have fun. After all, you won't be having much fun soon as you approach the Class 2 difficulties.
