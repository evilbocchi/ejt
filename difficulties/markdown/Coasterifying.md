# Coasterifying

Coasterifying is a Mid Class 1 sub-difficulty, ranked -6.66, situated between Flowerness and Pleasant (or A Difficulty Named Difficulty). Created on May 2, 2023 by Bryan, it has no sub-sub-difficulties, decal, or music, and is not part of any chains. Coasterifying is classified as humanly possible, being in the first class to do so, and is considered incredibly easy—hardly anyone should fail.

The main gimmick of this difficulty is the fun, roller-coaster-like nature of its obstacles. These can range from calm, small coasters to taller, more thrilling rides. The focus is not on speed or height, but on the difficulty itself. Only one type of coaster, the "Control-A-Cart," is used, similar to obby creator or cart ride games. Obstacles are minimal—it's all about the coaster experience, with features like inversions (with railings), sharp turns, and steep drops.
