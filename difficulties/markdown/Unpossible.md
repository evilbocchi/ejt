# Unpossible

Unpossible is a variation of a Class Negative Difficulty - Unimpossible. This version has been buffed one hundred billion times or more. If the original version of Unimpossible is Instant Win, this one is Instant Death. Most things about this difficulty are impossible, including humanly impossible, TAS impossible, physically impossible, and more. To even just get past the first barrier, you need an inexplicable amount of luck and skill. As a result, only hackers can circumvent this.

The difficulty is a successor to El Vacio and a predecessor to Universe Disruption. It was a part of the Class 9 rebirth chain, but everything else got deleted and this is the last piece of it.
