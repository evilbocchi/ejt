'''Maximum Overdrive''' is a difficulty that is reserved for Towers with obstacles that require more broken physics than Why difficulty. This is potentially the absolute limit of difficulty that humans are capable of doing. ([[The Human Limit|The Human Limit now]])

The origin of this difficulty was made by an unknown player from Sandbox (2) back in 2018, originally it was called "Borderline Impossible/True Borderline Impossible" but was later renamed to this. A single jump of this difficulty is already more difficult than the entirety of Tower of Spiralling Fates.

The range of the difficulty stems from High Why difficulty to Low No.

* Music you can use: 3988067092
*You can find this line in the episode "Krusty Krab Training Video"
*This was the first in the pixel art chain line to be deleted due to the chain being too long. This was its icon. [[File:Maximum overdrive pixel.png|frameless|30x30px]]

==Continuing From This Point ==
yeah good job props to you now start doing truly humanly impossible towers such as [[w:c:jtohs-hardest-towers:Tower of Tedious and Stodgy|Tower of Tedious and Stodgy]] or [[w:c:jtohs-hardest-towers:Maybe Eating a True Loaf of Absolute Failure|MEaTLoAF,]] or you can try somewhat easier towers like [[w:c:jtohs-hardest-towers:The Absolute|The Absolute.]]
