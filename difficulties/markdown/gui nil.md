# gui nil

gui nil is a joke difficulty that was only released on one server in The Stronghold, which has since shut down. There is only one tower in this difficulty: Mini Citadel of gui1808s Final Wrath. As a joke difficulty, gui nil is not part of the main progression and is known for its limited and humorous presence.
