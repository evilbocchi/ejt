[[File:Simple.png|25px]] <span id="simple">'''Simple'''</span> is a very straightforward difficulty that is located in [[:Category:Class 2|Bottom Class 2]]. Most players will have almost no trouble travelling through this difficulty. It is located between {{Class1Difficulties|Effortless|25px}} [[w:c:jtoh:Effortless|Effortless]] (or [[File:Playgrounddif.png|25px|link=Playground]] [[Playground]]) and {{Class1Difficulties|Easy|25px}} [[w:c:jtoh:Easy|Easy]]. This difficulty is the final sub difficulty of Effortless as well. Since it takes up about the '''high''' spectrum of its parent difficulty, it is recommend to do beginner towers in other EToH fan games as many are around this difficulty.                        
==Icon Representation==
<center>[[File:Simple.png|60x60px]]</center>
----
[[File:Simple.png|25px]] <span id="simple">'''Simple'''</span>s icon is, well, simple. All there really is here is a 2x2 checkerboard pattern. The top right corner and bottom left corners are a bright shade of green, while the other two corners are a darker shade of green.
==Obstacles==
As this is a sub-difficulty of an already simple difficulty, there will not be a spectrum.
*4.5 stud jump (C)
*4.3 stud jump (UC)
*0.975 stud wraparound (C)
*0.925 stud wraparound (UC)
