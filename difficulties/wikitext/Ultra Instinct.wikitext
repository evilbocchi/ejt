== Overview ==
'''[[Ultra Instinct]]''' is a Baseline [[:Category:Class 7|Class 7]] difficulty made by [[User:Octogoat YT|Octogoat YT]] and later revamped by [[User:TasmanianRex|TasmanianRex]]. It is between the [[File:SquareSupreme.png|25x25px]] [[Supreme]] or [[File:UnthinkableSquare.png|20x20px]] [[UNTHINKABLE]] and [[File:Mort.png|20x20px]] [[Mortifying]] difficulties, and its position was changed many times since the creation date. This difficulty used to have a sub difficulty named ''Super Saiyan'', but it was deleted due to rising standards of this wiki.

Obstacles on this difficulty requires the player to perform unknown glitches, pixel perfect jumps that require TAS to perform, and requires time and effort to attempt this difficulty. Comparing this to [[File:SquareSupreme.png|25x25px]] [[Supreme]] or [[File:UnthinkableSquare.png|20x20px]] [[UNTHINKABLE]], this difficulty is thrice as challenging in terms of obstacles and glitches.

You should attempt The Final Universe before this difficulty, but you need to practice hard. The challenge is that there is a lack of [[w:c:jtoh:Tower|Towers]] besides [[Main Difficulty Chart|Difficulty Chart Towers]], which they can take a while to complete. You should try to attempt the previous [[w:c:jtoh:Tower|Tower]] depending on the difficulty.

== Icon Representation ==

These upside down question marks indicate that this difficulty has unknown glitches that is challenging to perform successfully.

== Continuing from this point ==
After you have beaten this difficulty, you should attempt [[File:Mort.png|20x20px]] [[Mortifying]] as your next difficulty. [[Wicked Obstacle of Madness Yeeting|Wicked Obstacles of Madness Yeeting]] is the only [[w:c:jtoh:Tower|Tower]] with this difficulty, so attempting this [[w:c:jtoh:Tower|Tower]] would prepare you for the next difficulty.
