# Aleph-DEATH

Aleph-DEATH is a Physically Impossible Class 8 Sub-Difficulty, located between BobuxDeath and Limiting. With a rating of 88.5, it is beyond the reach of legitimate playâ€”only exploits or noclip could allow progress, which is not considered valid. Obstacles are massive and filled with instakills, making god mode essential. Originally a Class 23 difficulty, it was deleted and revived, now existing as a Class 12 difficulty.
