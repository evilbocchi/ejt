Obstacles in this difficulty will be harder than those in [[w:c:jtoh:Insane|<span style="color:blue;">'''Insane'''</span>]], which means that towers of this difficulty will be a huge challenge for most obbyists.

They require a very good amount of skill to beat, and obstacles of this level of difficulty will be mostly impossible for the average noob. This difficulty may even be a challenge for better obbyists. Beating a tower in this difficulty is a huge achievement.

{{NewHeader-Dynamic|text=Icon Representation}}

<span style="color:#0077ff;">'''Madness'''</span>’ icon is very simple, it’s just a blue square lighter than that of Insane, but darker than that of Extreme.

For its alternate icon, it’s a darker blue background with even darker blue stripes and a black :P face on it.

Turns out you are very skilled. The difficulty after this is [[Classical]], however, if you want to move through difficulties quicker, skip to [[w:c:jtoh:Extreme|Extreme]]. Try some low Extreme towers like [[w:c:jtoh:Tower of Bloodthirsty Kenos|Tower of Bloodthirsty Kenos]] and always remember to keep trying.
