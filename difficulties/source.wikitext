|-
|style="padding:10px"|<big>Hello, '''{{USERNAME}}'''! Welcome to the '''Difficulty Chart'''!</big>
This is the current official Difficulty Chart on the [[Eternal Joke Towers (EJT) Wiki]]. It includes all mainspace difficulty pages as well as chains. The chart is split into two parts to reduce lag from the byte count. Difficulties are split into classes, which are sections to classify difficulties appropriately. Each class is then split into a Baseline, Low, Middle, High, Peak and sometimes Skyline classification, with 3 Main Difficulties in each section. Difficulties can have sub-difficulties as well, to help bridge the gap between main difficulties, though this is mostly false due to most sub-difficulties appearing when they're least needed.

This is the first part of the chart, or the '''Regular Chart''' if you'll call it. It contains difficulties from Instantaneous to nearly Unbuildable. It starts as Class Negative, and moves up to Class 10. The second part of the chart, or the '''Spiritual Chart''' if you'll call it, contains Class 11 to Class 22, with a total of 25 classes. The second half includes difficulties that are literally unbuildable in the Roblox engine, to infinitely long obstacles to the absolute breakdown of definition. Anything above Penultimate is classified as ''''Rinti-Penultimate'''', which contains TUC and the [[:Category:Cardinals|cardinals]] and [[:Category:Ordinal Quintet|ordinals]].

There are also [[:Category:Unclassified|Unclassified]] difficulties for difficulties that can change depending on situations like luck, gimmicks, or arbitrariness. In specific circumstances, a difficulty may be in an [[:Category:Anonymous Placement|anonymous placement]], not fitting in any classes. [[:Category:Chains|Chains]] are a set of difficulties that relate to each other or are a set of connected difficulties. Currently there are 10 chains as of now. 

Certain difficulties may have a different status than the usual ones. These difficulties are special, in the case that they represent something that makes it special compared to others. The most common of these is a [[:Category:Class Finale Difficulties|Class Finale]], indicating the difference between each class. There are also [[:Category:Fabled Difficulty|Fabled]] difficulties, usually high quality, popular difficulties or degraded Legendary difficulties. [[:Category:Legendary Difficulty|Legendary]] difficulties are difficulties that have importance to the entire chart. Finally, there's the [[:Category:Primordial Difficulties|Primordial]] classification for the difficulties that form the entire chart.

|-
|style="padding:10px"|This section is dedicated to any Difficulty Chart changes that happen throughout the year. This includes slot changes, rating changes, difficulty additions and removals. Ever since the refining and standardization of the chart, recent changes start to become more rare, so this section is pretty useless most of the time. Only MDC and EDC changes are showcased.

| style="padding:10px" |Welcome to the start of the difficulty chart. These difficulties are so easy you're probably not noticing you're winning them so many times a second. In fact, as you are reading this, you're probably winning these difficulties an uncountable times per second. These difficulties are so easy that trying to lose them is as hard as the end of the difficulty chart itself. You don’t have to be in any Roblox game, let alone even doing anything. Some of these difficulties don’t even require you to exist.

These difficulties consist of the non-soul crushing EToH difficulties, the one you would find in the majority of EToH towers. This class ranges from small jumps such as a 1 stud wraparound in Effortless all the way up to advanced techniques like basic wall-hopping, 10 stud wraparounds, and many others.

|-
| style="padding:10px" |This class marks the start of soul crushing difficulties, and is near the limit of human possibility. People who beat towers of this class of difficulties are considered to be "Elite Obbyists". Many people beat towers such as [[w:c:jtoh:ToDC|Tower of Difficulty Chart]], [[w:c:jtoh:ToDT|Tower of Double Trouble]], or [[w:c:jtoh:ToTL|Tower of Thinning Layers]] as their first towers in this class. A lot of towers in this class are mostly [[w:c:jtoh:Purism|purist]], but plenty of towers in this class are based around client objects. Almost every tower in [[w:c:jtoh:PoM|Pit of Misery]] is in this class range as well.
People who make it to difficulties that are this deep are very good at obbies, whether they have 30 or 250 towers beaten. People on the higher end of Class 3 have beaten many towers in the top list, which might only be [[w:c:jtoh:Terrifying|Terrifying]]/[[w:c:jtoh:Catastrophic|Catastrophic]] or have even beaten the hardest towers verified, that is, [[w:c:jtoh:ToBF|Tower of Blind Fate]] and [[w:c:jtoh:CoIV|Citadel of Infinite Void]].

Many tiered obbyists, are in this class. For context, tiered obbies are [[w:c:jtoh:Purism|purist]] that usually do not have a frame, and have their own dimensions. They are usually the same length as EToH towers.

| style="padding:10px" | This class marks the start of human impossibility, at least in the case that towers in Bottom Class 4 haven’t been beaten yet. Obstacles in this class are still possible to do, but in some cases they are barely possible.

This class also contains most of [[w:c:jtohs-hardest-towers|JHT]], which is JToH’s Hardest Towers. It ends at Class 9.

Bottom Class 4 towers may be possible to beat, but the near-impossible obstacles present like RNG makes them practically humanly impossible. As a result, it is highly recommended to use TAS to beat towers of this difficulty.

It is also known as the red zone, due to every difficulty here being red-colored, as it was blasted into the volcano. Good luck, since these difficulties will be brutal, being past what was thought to be the limit of gameplay as a whole.

Also, random history facts! This class is a combination of previous class 6 (which started at Malicious and ended at Vicious, which was after Mischievous) and the first part of class 7, which was also known as the red zone. As a result, the icons of all the difficulties residing in the previous class 6 were changed to become red, and now class 6 looks super cool being red!

| style="padding:10px" |This class is the last class in physical possibility, and by extension, the last class of partial impossibility. This means that even with luck glitches, you might not be able to do obstacles in this difficulty. If at all there is a chance of being able to beat an obstacle in the lower end of this class without luck glitches, even with basic TAS usage, the chances are extremely slim.

There also happens to be two chains here; the Road to Pseudo-Difficulties, a prominent chain of former Class 7, and Mike's Difficulty Chart chain, which was a former member of Class 8, initially consisting of 5 main difficulties, which have since then become 2 main difficulties and 3 sub-difficulties.

Obstacles also start to get exponentially larger in size. At this point, the gaps between difficulties drift farther and farther apart, comparable to comparing the easiest of EToH towers to the hardest ones.

Some towers in this difficulty are even super-buffed variants of some iconic EToH towers.

This class is also home to 2 popular difficulties from old EJT, both of which are now fabled difficulties.
