==Introduction ≈ [[File:Locomotion.png|30px]] Locomotion==
Well done on surpassing the joyous difficulty [[File:Happylike remake.png|25x25px|frameless]] [[Happylike]]! It was extremely easy completing all of its obstacles. Now you move on to more motion upon the difficulty [[File:Locomotion.png|25px]] Locomotion. You will be introduced to conveyors, a new object. Conveyors transport you (or any other parts) to different places. Conveyors have a abillity upon editing them to either change the speed, show their arrows, etc. This difficulty will only showcase you the fast conveyors, as the slow conveyors will be in the difficulties like [[File:Unlosable.png|25px]] [[Unlosable]] and [[File:AutomaticNew.png|25px]] [[Automatic]]. Conveyors are common parts, meaning you will see them on a lot of more difficulties soon.

This difficulty is the last difficulty for breaks, as you are preparing for the main difficulties that are in the Official Difficulty Chart. All of these difficulties in this class are very easy, so you are still allowed to skip this class (and maybe the next class).

Locomotion is a humanly possible, unofficial difficulty created on the 5th of July, 2023 by Astro6284. It is before [[File:Walkthrough.png|25px]] [[Walkthrough]] and after [[File:Happylike remake.png|25x25px|frameless]] [[Happylike]]. The difficulty used to located on Class Upper Negative (Class -1B), which was the result of C-1 spliting to twos. Now it is located in Class 0 due to TDEx/TDA.
