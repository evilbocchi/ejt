# Aesthetic

Aesthetic is a humanly possible sub-difficulty in Class 1, positioned between Sweet and Lovely. It is primarily focused on design and aesthetics rather than challenge. Towers with this difficulty resemble art galleries, filled with various images and simple obstacles. The main challenge is simply reaching the winpad, with the only real obstacles being distractions or leaving the game.
