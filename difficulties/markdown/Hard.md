# Hard

Hard is a difficulty in EToH represented by an orange square. It follows Medium and precedes Difficult. Obstacles in Hard are similar to those in Medium but are more numerous and often include disappearing platforms and conveyors. Towers at this level can take 8-15 minutes to complete and are intended for above-average obbyists.

Players can expect a noticeable increase in challenge compared to previous difficulties, and some may struggle with certain sections. Hard is a key step for players looking to improve their skills and tackle more advanced towers.
