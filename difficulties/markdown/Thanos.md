# Thanos

Thanos was a sub-difficulty represented by the color Indigo, placed to the left side of Insane on the Difficulty Chart. It was formerly exclusive to one Tower, Thanos Tower in Ring 1. Thanos Tower was considered High-Peak Insane back then, and the difficulty was removed from the game due to its limited use. Since its removal, there is a grave in Thanos Tower's winroom reading "R.I.P Thanos Difficulty."

Thanos difficulty was used for only one tower and was removed, similar to other rare or discontinued difficulties.
