==Intro==

<span style="font-family:Comfortaa;"><span style="text-shadow: grey 0px 3px 3px;">ILOVEYOU</span></span> is a baseline Class 8, ranked 77.5, is in-between other main difficulties, [[File:Hellifying.png|30px]] [[Agony]] and [[File:2020 09 21 Kleki.png|30px]] [[Abyssal]]. Created on April 18, 2023 by [[User:Bryanjr7747|Bryan]], ILOVEYOU has no sub-difficulties, decal, or music. Lastly, ILOVEYOU isn't in any chains, hasn't been revived, revamped, or removed.

<span style="font-family:Comfortaa;"><span style="text-shadow: grey 0px 3px 3px;">ILOVEYOU</span></span> is classified as a physically impossible difficulty, which means it is impossible to do even with '''''TAS''''', you must defy roblox physics in order to win. It is near the middle of the physically impossible range.. So good luck with that.

The ILOVEYOU virus comes in an email with "ILOVEYOU" in the subject line and contains an attachment that, when opened, results in the message being re-sent to everyone in the recipient's Microsoft Outlook address book. This virus alone costed US$5.5–8.7 billion in damages worldwide, and estimated to cost US$10–15 billion to remove the worm. Within ten days, over fifty million infections had been reported, and it is estimated that 10% of Internet-connected computers in the world had been affected.

There is many gimmicks, but more of them are practically catches then anything, such as screen being covered, ads everywhere.

Moving onto icon representation..

==Icon representation==
[[File:ILOVEYOU.png|200px]]<br>
It is a email from a while ago. In the top, we see the blue tab with the message (which reads "ILOVEYOU - Message (Rich Text), minimize, fullscreen, and close buttons.<br>
Just below that, we see some settings, those being "<u>F</u>ile", "<u>E</u>dit", "<u>V</u>iew", "<u>I</u>nsert", "F<u>o</u>rmat", "<u>T</u>ools", "<u>A</u>ctions", "T<u>a</u>ble", and "<u>H</u>elp".<br>
And a bit more below, we see the "<u>R</u>eply", "Reply to A<u>l</u>l", "For<u>w</u>ard", Paste, and copy buttons.<br>
Even more below that is the message info. Its from "John Doe", to "John Doe", no CC, but the subject being "ILOVEYOU". The message was also sent at Thursday, 5/4/00 at 11:29 AM.<br>
Now, were at the message! It reads "kindly check the attached LOVELETTER coming from me." The file name is "LOVE-LETTER-FOR-YOU.TXT.vbs"<br>
One last thing, there are just useless stuff on the side, and bottom.
