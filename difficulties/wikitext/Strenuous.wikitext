[[File:Strenuous2.png|frameless|32x32px]] '''<span style="color:#9E0000">Strenuous</span>''' is a [[:Category:Class 2|Mid Class 2]] Sub-Difficulty that is harder than {{Class2Difficulties|Difficult}} [[w:c:jtoh:Difficult|Difficult]], but easier than [[File:MenacingDifficulty.png|link=Menacing|30x30px]] [[Menacing]]. It is the last difficulty of Mid Class 2, and jumps here start to get harder. Now there are such obstacles as getting to {{Class1Difficulties|Hard}} [[w:c:jtoh:Hard|Hard]] in a difficulty chart obby, getting to {{Class2Difficulties|Difficult}} [[w:c:jtoh:Difficult|Difficult]] a one jump per difficulty chart obby, and more than that.

If you are just getting better at obbies, I recommend you beat a tower with the rating of {{Class1Difficulties|Hard}} [[w:c:jtoh:Hard|Hard]], and practice a few {{Class2Difficulties|Difficult}} [[w:c:jtoh:Difficult|Difficult]] obstacles, due to you soon moving onto that difficulty. If you do that, I have no doubt you will surmount a tower with this difficulty in 30 minutes or less. Due to the average Robloxian only being able to beat about {{Class1Difficulties|Medium}} [[w:c:jtoh:Medium|Medium]] difficulty obstacles, this is a much bigger step up than what a normal person could generally accomplish, without assists.
==Icon Representation==

=== Current ===
[[File:Strenuous2.png|center|frameless|85x85px]]
The new icon is much more accurate to it's JToH neighbors. It's dark red, but not as dark as Challenging's red. The RGB is (158, 0, 0).

==Trivia== 
*[[User:The Difficulty Enthusiast|TDE]] fixed up this page.   
**[[User:Bruhshard1|Bruhshard]] changed the classification a little bit.  
***This was for.. A7.
* The caption is fake. it says it's starting to get very hard.
** However, Very Hard is the old name for Difficult, and we're already past it.
*** A perfect fix for this is stating that it's about to get super hard.
* Credit to [[Relentless]] for the background thingy. 
*N/A
