<span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:100%;background:-webkit-linear-gradient(90deg, #00FFFF, #FFFFFF);-webkit-background-clip:text;-webkit-text-fill-color:transparent;">Petrifying</span> is a Class 3 difficulty, being considered tougher and more onerous to surpass than {{Class3Difficulties|Terrifying|25px}} [[w:c:jtoh:Terrifying|Terrifying]], yet being considered easier and more elementary to surpass than {{Class3Difficulties|Catastrophic|25px}} [[w:c:jtoh:Catastrophic|Catastrophic]], the final canon '''Juke's Towers of Hell''' difficulty. 

However, this difficulty is alternatively considered as tougher and more onerous to surpass than [[File:Horrifying.PNG|25x25px|link=Horrifying]] [[Horrifying]], as well as being easier and more elementary to surpass than [[File:Alarming.png|25x25px|link=User blog:EpicTheGamer2014/Alarming]] [[User blog:EpicTheGamer2014/Alarming|Alarming]], which is also this difficulties only sub-difficulty.

This difficulty resides within the range of canon '''Juke's Towers of Hell''', being the penultimate canon non-sub difficulty within this range. However, it could alternatively be considered the antepenultimate, if one was to consider [[File:DorcelessnessDifficulty.png|25x25px|link=Dorcelessness]] [[User blog:EpicTheGamer2014/Dorcelessness|Dorcelessness]] as within this range.

This difficulty is equivalent to around an old iteration of [[w:c:jtoh:Tower of Augmented Misery|Tower of Augmented Misery]], due to this old iteration being considered by many too hard to be deemed {{Class3Difficulties|Terrifying|25px}} [[w:c:jtoh:Terrifying|Terrifying]], yet too easy to be deemed {{Class3Difficulties|Catastrophic|25px}} [[w:c:jtoh:Catastrophic|Catastrophic]], hence it has a specific placement between those difficulties.

==Trivia==

*This difficulty was conceptualized 10 months after the original file was uploaded.
*This is the third instance of a difficulty in this specific placement, and the only active instance. 
**The inactive instances in question are [[File:74E50275-85D4-471F-916B-A8CEDB2B83B6.png|25px]] '''Get fling horizontally''' and [[File:Galactical Limitation.png|25px]] [[User blog:The Difficulty Enthusiast/Galactic|'''Galactic''']].
*This difficulty was inspired by [[File:PiUnbuff.png|25px]] [[User blog:AlsoOmori/Pi|Pi]], which was inherently inspired by [[File:Nightmare.png|25px]] [[Nightmare]], therefore by extension making this inspired by the aforementioned difficulty.

==Continuing on from this point==
A virtuosic soul who had surpassed this difficulty after tons of amassed effort on towers such as [[w:c:jtoh:Tower of Nervous Sweating|Tower of Nervous Sweating]], their main objective would be {{Class3Difficulties|Catastrophic|25px}} [[w:c:jtoh:Catastrophic|Catastrophic]].
