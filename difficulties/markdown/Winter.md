Welcome to Winter, the first difficulty of the RoPD chain (or at least, Road of Pseudo Difficulties). Anyone completing this difficulty may want to know that this difficulty has a rating of 46, despite it being the beginning of the RoPD chain, to let anyone attempting to surpass this prepare for the legendary difficulty, Supreme. It still requires a lot of effort and practice to pass this difficulty, even in the 256th bit.

This difficulty is insurmountable by any life form, with the exception of the powerful boosts and cheats. The only way to beat this difficulty is by using good exploits, since it's the only tool that is required for this difficulty to be beaten. This difficulty also features many very cold aesthetics, which may make anyone completing this difficulty receive a cold or frostbite. Hot chocolate here is also helpful for this difficulty.
