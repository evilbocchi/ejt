# Omniscient

Omniscient is a physically impossible difficulty located in the mid-range of Class 9, harder than Aleph-Something but easier than Enigmatic. Structures of this difficulty cannot be accurately built in most obby games and require advanced building tools. Completing an Omniscient structure rewards the player with the Gift of Omniscience, a powerful item for tackling even greater challenges.
