==Introduction ==
'''Malicious''' is the hardest real difficulty on EHT and is represented with a light grey background and a faded pentagram. This difficulty is even harder than [[Immeasurable|<span style="color:#5c2525; text-shadow:0 0 4px #000">'''Immeasurable'''</span>]]. Currently, there is no determiner for this difficulty due to its ludicrous placement, so it's not the brightest idea to even think about building - or even worse, attempting - a Malicious tower. It will not be beaten. EVER.

==Towers in This Difficulty==
* NEATU - [[Not Even A Tower Ultra]] (Low Malicious?)
* ToLT - [[Tower of Lucid Terror]] (Low-Mid Malicious)
*MN - [[Malicious Neat]] (Mid Malicious?)
*CT - [[Chaotic Tower]] (High-Peak Malicious)
*TT - [[Tower Tower]] (Skyline Malicious)

==Trivia== 

*This difficulty used to be represented with a light gray background with a red pentagram, but was changed in March, 2020.
**This was likely because the icon was poorly made and looked awful.
**Additionally, there was a version of Malicious between the original and the current one, which is just the current one but it looks pixelated.
** The difficulty was finally outlined on March 22nd of 2024.
* The background color of the difficulty is 192, 192, 192 and the pentagram is 161, 161, 161.
