# SUFFER

SUFFER is a Class 4 Difficulty which succeeds Omega and precedes Aleph-Null or CHAOS. It is notorious for tormenting glitches, such as book glitch wraps or very fast falling platforms with instakills. SUFFER is significantly tougher and generally more impossible than Omega, but remains easier than Aleph-Null or CHAOS. The current icon is a maroon to red gradient with a black evil cat face emoticon.
