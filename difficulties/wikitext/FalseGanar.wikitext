== [[File:FalseGanar Z.png|frameless|30x30px]] '''FalseGanar''' - Explanation ==
[[File:FalseGanar Z.png|frameless|30x30px]] '''FalseGanar''' is a High Class 7 difficulty that is between [[File:New UG.jpg|frameless|30x30px]] '''[[Universal Glitch]]''' and [[File:HopelessNewest.png|frameless|30x30px]] [[Hopeless]]. This difficulty was made by '''[[User:OqYTRXD|OqYTRXD]]''' on 5/14/2022. [[File:FalseGanar Z.png|frameless|30x30px]] '''FalseGanar''' has a very confusing name. The meaning of the name is that "false" means "fake" in English, and "ganar" means "win" in Spanish, so the full meaning of the name is "Fake Win". It represents how hard and ridiculous the difficulty is. The obstacles are terrifying, tight and accurate, and you need huge amounts of luck to able to complete them. This difficulty is harder than 10,000 floors of [[File:DEATH-0.webp|frameless|30x30px]] '''[[w:c:jtohs-hardest-towers:DEATH|Death]]''' and [[File:RoorXD.png|frameless|30x30px]] '''[[w:c:jtohs-hardest-towers:RoorXD|RoorXD]]''' combined, so passing through this difficulty's obstacles consists of many years of practice.                  

== [[File:FalseGanar Z.png|frameless|30x30px]] '''FalseGanar''' - Icon Representation ==
[[File:FalseGanar Z.png|frameless|30x30px]] '''FalseGanar'''<nowiki/>'s icon doesn't have very much detail. Firstly, there is a black background with a white gradient on the bottom. And lastly, there are a transparent skull on the middle of the screen that had it mouth disappear and it's almost impossible to see. It's represented a skull falling down to the void. Maybe it will happen to you when you reach [[File:2020 09 5675.png|frameless|30x30px]] '''[[Void]].''' A typically High Class 7.
