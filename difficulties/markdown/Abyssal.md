# Abyssal

Abyssal is the third Class 8 difficulty and the final regular difficulty before Reality and Virtual Reality difficulties. It represents the last barrier before the most extreme challenges. Passing Abyssal requires insane tricks and glitches, and while it is extremely hard, even more difficult challenges lie ahead. The obstacles here are so impossible that MegaDeath is considered easy in comparison.
