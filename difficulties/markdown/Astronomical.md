# Astronomical

Astronomical is a baseline Class 0 Sub-Difficulty of Millisecondless. This is between Millisecondless and Win with a difficulty rating of -85 and a Kol Metric of ~|0|.

Right off the bat this is buildable and humanly possible! This is the second to last instant win difficulty in the entire chart, so after this is just waiting, jumping, ladder, flicks, conveyors, and more.

The only way you can actually lose is if the teleporter is broken or anything is displayed of Restful and more.
