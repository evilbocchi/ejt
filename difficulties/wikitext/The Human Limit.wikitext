<h2 class="head">What is [[File:TheHumanLimit.png|30px]] <span id="thl">The Human Limit</span>?</h2>
[[File:TheHumanLimit.png|25px]] <span id="thl">The Human Limit</span> ('''THL'''), originally known as '''Zilch''', is an [[:Category:Official|official]] sub-difficulty in [[:Category:Class 3|Class 3]] or in [[Alternate Difficulty Chart]] standards, it is a Peak-[[:Category:Class 3|Class 3]] sub-difficulty, located in-between [[File:Anguish2.png|24px]] [[Anguish]] & {{Class4Difficulties|Nil|24px}} [[w:c:jtoh:nil|nil]]. Any [[w:c:jtoh:Towers|tower]] designed to be [[:Category:Humanly Impossible|humanly-impossible]] or just beyond this, will be placed in {{Class4Difficulties|Nil|24px}} [[w:c:jtoh:nil|nil]] or above.

[[File:TheHumanLimit.png|25px]] <span id="thl">The Human Limit</span>, hence it's name, is the absolute peak of human capability in-terms of skill. Anything beyond this will very well be <u>humanly impossible</u>, obstacles of this difficulty require precision, accuracy, timing & posistion which test human capabilities and are ''actually'' borderline-impossible, these obstacles are actually extremely tough & can take tons of experience, practice & skill even for an elite obbyist. Sometimes obstacles are ''near'' frame-perfect due to the immense timing, posistioning and precision you need to even accomplish one of these jumps. Unfortunately, <u>no player has ever acquired the skillset and such reaction time to even complete a single tower of this difficulty.</u>

<h3><span style="font-family:Georgia">Why Is It The Limit?</span></h3>
<center>''This section is reserved for people trying to debunk this difficulty from the human limit title.''</center>

For starters, [[File:TheHumanLimit.png|25px]] <span id="thl">The Human Limit</span> utilises a variety of jumps that are ''near'' human impossibility & requires near-inhuman precision, timing and accuracy. Jumps <u>can be done</u> by humans, but if anything else is harder than it, it would simply be a baseline-humanly impossible jump. [[w:c:jtoh:Towers|Towers]] of this difficulty utilise a bunch of these nigh-humanly-impossible jumps that are basically half a stud away from being impossible, note that luck-based jumps such as a 14.5 stud-wrap are ''not'' skill-based. This difficulty focuses entirely on the peak skill-point a human can have and the <u>hardest</u> jumps a human can ever do consistently using skill without including the element of luck. The difference between this and {{Class4Difficulties|Nil|24px}} [[w:c:jtoh:nil|nil]] is that jumps from ''nil'' can be done, and it includes RNG. But putting all those jumps into a single tower, would make the tower humanly-impossible. This is due to the fact that having to do all those jumps in groups, would require inhuman precision.

[[File:TheHumanLimit.png|25px]] <span id="thl">The Human Limit</span> on the other hand, utilises jumps that are the peak of human capability <u>using skill</u>. And putting the jumps into one single tower, would still have the tower just barely humanly-possible. But still however humanly-possible. Due to still being just at the line of human impossibility, technically it ''would'' still be possible.

<h2 class="head">Obstacle Introduction</h2>
[[File:TheHumanLimit.png|25px]] <span id="thl">The Human Limit</span> utilise insane variety of obstacles and jumps, most of which are <u>nigh-humanly impossible</u>. The punishment is also extremely cruel, as one fail could end your run due, this difficulty basically exceeds and tests how much a human could be capable of doingalong with the incorporation of: extreme length (similar to [[w:c:jtoh:Citadel of Void|Citadel of Void]], unindicated traps, absolutely gruesome jumps & more. Basically any element which is supposedly nigh-humanly impossible but still allowing the player to get consistent (if they even manage to get good enough) basically, these obstacles are quite janky and mostly purist. The tier of this difficulty would be <u>Tier 18-20</u>, this difficulty utilises a bunch of janky obstacles and extremely precisional timings and glitches, such as a mid-air corner-flip (& includes a small wrap you need to do mid-air to land on the platform). Jumps of this difficuly are just plain stupid & absurdly accurate. Even just one mistake and it could cost your entire [[File:TheHumanLimit.png|25px]] <span id="thl">The Human Limit</span> difficulty tower run. However, there is some RNG included in this difficulty, but not because you need to have luck, it is because physics can mess up your run and that would not be very nice at all.

I don't really think i have much to say really now, other than <u>these jumps & obstacles are absurdly accurate and almost impossible and require tons of effort, practice, experience, skill, accuracy, posistioning, persistence, timing and a bit of luck on your side.</u>

<h3>Obstacles</h3>
Currently, obstacles here arenâ€™t really defined too well, as the human limit is very wobbly, as it changes a lot. While obstacles may be supported soon, for the time being obstacles of towers such as ToRF will suffice for a THL tower.

<h2 class="head">Trivia</h2>
*In the old version, [[File:TheHumanLimit.png|25px]] <span id="thl">The Human Limit</span> took about a few days to finish, despite the fact it only needed an hour or so to get finished.
** This is due to the creator ([[User:Rarezites|Rarezites]]â€™ inability to focus on one specific project to do (still affect them to this day)
**The revamped version took a day to make due to some procrastination & school.
*The difficulty was made by [[User:Rarezites|Rarezites]], but is now owned by [[User:Sanjay2133|Sanjay2133]], due to the original creator giving him the difficulty.
**'''SPOILER BLUR ('''contains sensitive topics) <span class="spoilerblur">Rarezites gave the difficulty to Sanjay2133 briefly before leaving the wiki forever, due to her committing suicide because of depression. Rest in peace, Rarezites, and may you forever be remembered on [[A Tribute to Rarezites]]</span>
* The difficulty was originally intended to be named '''Null''', however it never did due to [[Null]] being already a taken name, shortly after, it was ''Zilch'' but then it was already taken too! (that is, before it got deleted)
*This might have been one of the most high-quality sub-difficulties of the wiki, despite this, the creator didn't really feel like it was good enough.
**Which is why this was revamped.
*This sub-difficulty was a former [[:Category:Mythical Difficulty|Mythical Difficulty]] due to it being the human limit, it was taken away due to Mythical's removal.
**However, an administrator removed it's rank with the reason of "doesnt deserve mythical".
***It was eventually reinstated as a Fabled Difficulty after that classification was formed.
****Eventually, it was moved to be a Legendary Difficulty during the Hierarchy Revamp.
*The revamp was inspired by {{Class4Difficulties|Nil|24px}} [[w:c:nil|nil]] & [[File:AbsurdNewIcon.jpeg|24px]] [[Absurd]].
*This difficulty does not have an icon representation & a continuing from this point as i think its absolutely pointless.
