# Dissension

Dissension is a peak Class 7, physically impossible sub-difficulty that once served as the finale of the official chart before MegaDeath took its place. It sits between Doog and MegaDeath and is known for being absolutely, inexorably beyond any form of possibility. The difficulty extends far beyond the tier list, with obstacles that are nearly insurmountable. Dissension is a true test of endurance and skill, marking the end of an era before the arrival of even greater challenges.
