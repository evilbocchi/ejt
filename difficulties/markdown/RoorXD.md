# RoorXD

RoorXD is a Physically Impossible difficulty placed above Malicious in the chart. It is represented by a black icon with a white skull and is known for containing obstacles that are unverified or unintentionally impossible. RoorXD serves as a classification for challenges that were meant to be a different difficulty but ended up being impossible. It is similar in spirit to the "TooHard" or "WHY" difficulties, representing the theoretical limits of what can be built and completed.
