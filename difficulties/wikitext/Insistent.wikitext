==Overview==
[[File:Insistent.png|30px]] <span id="insistent">Insistent</span> is a Normal difficulty settled in the reaches of Middle Class 6, successing [[File:Absolutism.png|30px]] [[Absolutism]] and preceding [[File:Shocking.png|30px]] [[Shocking]]. It is regarded humanly impossible, rendering any legitimate attempts at an [[File:Insistent.png|30px]] <span id="insistent">Insistent</span> ranked obby futile. To have even the slimmest likelihood of completing any of the grueling obstacles [[File:Insistent.png|30px]] <span id="insistent">Insistent</span> obbies have, a player must be prepared with particular tools that can help overcome the hindrances.

[[File:Insistent.png|30px]] <span id="insistent">Insistent</span> towers and obbies are made for entertainment purposes, and are not meant to be attempted legitimately.

|rowspan="2" style="line-height: 1.6"|This icon was created by [[User:YataDev|YataDev]], and consists of a mint-green phi symbol from the Greek alphabet, placed on a black-to-green gradient background. The icon has an overlayed green outline as well, and a semi-transparent four-pointed star of a similar color to the icon's outline in each corner.

== Obstacles ==
As previously stated, [[File:Insistent.png|30px]] <span id="insistent">Insistent</span> contains obstacles that are humanly impossible to overcome without the use of additional tools and gear. Below is an example list of obstacles to help builders understand how to design them and to inform players about what challenges to expect from an [[File:Insistent.png|30px]] <span id="insistent">Insistent</span> difficulty obby.

Such obstacles, on top of being humanly impossible with default Humanoid properties, require insane luck and precision. Obstacles like these should not be attempted without special tools.

*It is the first properly made and finished difficulty made by [[User:YataDev|YataDev]] in over 2 years.
== Completion ==
After completing [[File:Insistent.png|30px]] <span id="insistent">Insistent</span>, a difficulty that should not be humanly feasible, an obby of [[File:Shocking.png|30px]] [[Shocking]] should be attempted next, if one expects something of higher difficulty.
