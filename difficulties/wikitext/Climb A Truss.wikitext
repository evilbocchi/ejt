==Introduction==
{{Class0Difficulties|Climb A Truss}} <span style="color:#868686; text-shadow:0 0 2px #000">'''{{PAGENAME}}'''</span> (<span style="color:#868686; text-shadow:0 0 2px #000">'''CAT'''</span>) is a baseline [[:Category:Class 1|Class 1]] difficulty<sup>sometimes a sub-difficulty</sup> rated -12 in the [[Main Difficulty Chart]] which follows {{Class0Difficulties|Press a Key}} [[Press a Key]] and its sub-difficulties, {{Class0Difficulties|Tap to Move}} [[Tap to Move]] and {{Class0Difficulties|Walk A Slope}} [[Walk A Slope]], but is placed before {{Class0Difficulties|Jumpless}} [[Jumpless]], as well as its own sub-difficulty, {{Class0Difficulties|Tranquil}} [[Tranquil]]. It is a pretty simple difficulty, as all you need to do is climb a truss. The truss can vary in size, however, and can be anywhere from 4 studs long up to 10K studs long, where you'd have to hold the W key for a while.

==Icon Representation==
{{IconRepresentationAlternate|image=[[File:Cat.png|50px]]|color=#868686|description=This icon simply displays a gray background with "CAT" as black text on it. It's pretty simple and similar to {{Class0Difficulties|Press a Key}} [[Press a Key]]'s icon.|alt_color=#868686|alt_image=[[File:ClimbATruss1.5.png|50px]]|alt_description=This icon is pretty similar to the current icon; it has a gray background with its foreground being text, "CAT". However, the A in CAT was resized to be smaller, and two trusses were added; one on the bottom left corner, and one on the top right.}}

==Trivia==
*This difficulty is sometimes considered a sub-difficulty of {{Class0Difficulties|Press a Key}} [[Press a Key]].
*Before this difficulty was revamped, this section and the [[Climb A Truss#Icon Representation|Icon Representation]] section didn't exist.
*This difficulty's revamper made this whole revamp in a couple of hours, with more adjustments later on.
*<span style="color:#868686; text-shadow:0 0 2px #000">'''{{PAGENAME}}'''</span> is somewhat frequently found in things such as difficulty chart towers.
