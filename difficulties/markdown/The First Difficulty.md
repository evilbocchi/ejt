# The First Difficulty

The First Difficulty is the absolute beginning of your journey and the easiest of all difficulties. It is even below The Lower Gap and anything in between. This difficulty is the exact opposite of The Final Difficulty. Instead of being infinitely unbeatable, it is infinitely unlosable, no matter what kind of logic is applied.

There is no exception to winning. Even if you don't exist, or have infinite power, you will always win this difficulty. It is impossible to build, even with unlimited scripting capabilities. Losing this difficulty is as hard as beating The Final Difficulty, and beating The Final Difficulty is as hard as losing this one. You just can't lose.
