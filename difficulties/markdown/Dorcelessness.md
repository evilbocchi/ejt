# Dorcelessness

Dorcelessness is a difficulty that is not found inside of JToH. This difficulty resides between Eccentric and Horrific. It is meant to border the two difficulties, while also containing towers from the peak of the Catastrophic difficulty. Dorcelessness is represented by a light pink square surrounded by many triangles with varying shades of pastel pink, with the center displaying many small cracks in a stained glass-like pattern.

This difficulty contains some extremely difficult jumps that even the current best obbyists will struggle with. Many of these jumps can be found within towers such as Tower of Cruel Punishment and Tower of Vacant Hindrances.
