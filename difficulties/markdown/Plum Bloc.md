# Plum Bloc

Plum Bloc is a High Class 7 difficulty, placed between Hopeless and Infinity. It is physically impossibleâ€”no tool, TAS, or exploit can help you, as all are banned. The difficulty is notorious for its impossibility, and even attempting it is considered futile. The icon features the text "plum bloc" with a white vignette.
