# QUANTUM

Quantum is a Class 6 difficulty that comes after Oblivion and before Miracle, being slightly harder than Oblivion. It is considered the absolute border for using macros to beat a tower. To complete a Quantum difficulty tower, one would need a perfect macro, possibly running on a quantum computer, and even then, it would take weeks or months for the macro to succeed. Quantum represents a point where human skill is no longer sufficient, and even advanced automation struggles to achieve victory.
