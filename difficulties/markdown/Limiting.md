# Limiting

Limiting is a Peak Class 8, Physically Impossible difficulty, known as the penultimate challenge before entering the Realm of Theoretical Impossibility. It comes after BobuxDeath and before The Crystal Core. Limiting is extremely hard, requiring advanced techniques and a high tolerance for RNG and physically impossible gameplay.

The icon features a black exterior with a grey octagon and a >:D in the center. Limiting is filled with absurd, theoretical obstacles and is designed to test if players are ready for the next class. It is a collaboration between UnfoundLight and Sanjay2133, and is infamous for its over-the-top requirements and humor.
