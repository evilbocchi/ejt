# Agony

Agony is the first difficulty in Class 8, known as the 'Near-Unbuildable Class.' It marks the beginning of physically impossible challenges. Even a single jump in Agony is a monumental feat, as the obstacles defy logic and are considered unbeatable. The difficulty is filled with traps and decoys, making first-try completions impossible. Only with extreme exploits or overpowered items could anyone hope to progress.
