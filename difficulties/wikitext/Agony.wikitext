{{BetterQuote|text=So. I see you’ve passed [[File:Epitome.png|30px]] [[Epitome]]. I regret to inform you, however, that you’re probably at your final stopping point. 
Welcome to Class 8! This is often called the ‘Near-Unbuildable Class’, although it is FAR from unbuildable. This is also the class where Physical Impossibility begins, according to the template. You are now facing [[File:Hellifying.png|frameless|30x30px]] <span style="color:pink">Agony</span>, and continuing after this is probably not a good idea, considering the third legendary, Dilly Impossible, has a boss with the HP of the signed integer limit.|quoter=???}}

However, when the creator regained motivation, it was revived by the author. It is located directly surpassing [[File:Epitome.png|30px]] [[Epitome]] and is located directly preceding the livid [[File:2020 09 21 Kleki.png|30px]] [[Abyssal]]. '''Agony''' necessitates physically impossible obstacles, breaking logic of Roblox obbying, due to how high up in the difficulty chart this is located in. 

Even just accomplishing a singular jump of this difficulty is a feat in gaming that will never be surpassed, due to the fact that the jumps are so mind-bogglingly impossible, they are unbeatable. There are decoys and traps hidden with the rest of the gameplay, which are impossible to detect on your first run, meaning there are no ‘first-try’ completions of [[File:Hellifying.png|frameless|30x30px]] <span style="color:pink">'''Agony'''</span>, and there never will be. 

Furthermore, not even the most precise TAS there is could help you, so you must dive into sketchy exploits, and overpowered items only for important people in the community, like JToH’s Blessed Coil, in order to even have a nanoscopic chance of surpassing [[File:Hellifying.png|frameless|30x30px]] <span style="color:pink">'''Agony'''</span>. 

==Icon Representation ==
Dont know why this is here, but it’s standard for every difficulty now, so yeah, cry about it.

It is a light grey icon, with a white border. There is a black XD in the middle, and lots of filters, like glitch and RGB shift featured in this icon. It’s simplistic.

This icon may not look complicated, but it is. Firstly, there is a white, pixelated XD in the middle. Secondly, there is some turquoise radial gradation, and there is a slight bit of speed lines coming up through the bottom right corner. Yeah, that’s it.

The oldest icon is {{Class4Difficulties|HELL}} [[w:c:jtohs-hardest-towers:HELL|HELL]]s icon, but heavily modified. The colors are a lot darker, the XD has been changed to a DX, there are laser eyes in the DX, and there is some bright red in each corner.

==Continuing on from this point==
Well, I guess I was wrong. You have proven yourself to be able to advance onto the rest of Class 8. After trillions of years, you have surpassed yet another difficulty. You are able to move onto [[File:2020 09 21 Kleki.png|30px]] [[Abyssal]] difficulty.{{DifficultiesNavbox}}
