# Excavation Chain

The Excavation Chain is based on the game Button Simulator: Excavation Discoveries and consists of 30 different difficulties. Created by Sanjay2133, the chain is themed on the normal stats of Button Simulator: ED. The original branch is linked on the Button Simulator: ED wiki. All difficulty pages are provided in subpages to avoid filling the wiki with 30 separate pages.
