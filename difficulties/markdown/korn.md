# korn

korn is a custom, joke difficulty used for co-op towers, especially in the Event Realm. It is the only transparent difficulty in EToH, making it unique and often confusing for players who don't check the chart. The name is always lowercase, and the difficulty is not tied to a specific challenge level, allowing for a wide range of tower difficulties.

korn, nil, and gui remorseless are the only difficulties in EToH without capital letters in their names. It is notable for its use in event and co-op content, and its flexible, undefined nature.
