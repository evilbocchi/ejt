==Overview==
{{BetterQuote|text=The deepest parts of the cave relies something mysterious. The gigantic beautiful crystal is extremely valuable and make someone rich one day. It is challenging and millions will die attempting to mine the crystal. Should you prevail and become a hero one day?|quoter= Narrator}}[[{{PAGENAME}}]] is a [[:Category:Class 8|class 8]] difficulty, and specifically, a fabled difficulty. If built, it is obviously impossible and would have a 500x500 frame, as it is a former legendary difficulty. You should not succeed, as this difficulty is somehow harder than [[MegaDeath]] and anything else previous. Huh, you think I’d go down that easy? Well, we aren’t even through half the classes.

The official music used for towers will be no longer anything but [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qllRVZnpttM Crystallion - Crystal Clear]. There are some, few music suggestions recommended by the comments of this article, though they do not match the requirement, as the official music rule listed in [[:Category:Fabled Difficulty|Fabled Difficulty]] has to be Extreme Heavy Music (The music for this does not match the rule, but it is a near-instance to it.)

'''<big>NOTICE: Since the song has not been uploaded to the Roblox audio library yet, you may instead use another song.</big>'''

If you die here, you might as well die in real life.

also, if you're wondering "but this isnt a surreal difficulty!" just go with the flow there's a difficulty that's a picture of a gtag player called bryanjr, so don't question the diffigods
==Icon Representation==
{{IconRepresentationOfficialOnly|image=[[File:Screenshot 2020-09-26 032504.jpg|50px]]|description=The icon is a transparent crystal that has a rough shape. It is surrounded by blue lights, and the crystal reflects it around. At the bottom of the crystal, it is the brightest point, and it illuminates the picture. Near the edges of the icon, the background is navy blue due to the lighting.}}

==Obstacles==
'''''Warning:''' Obstacles may be inaccurate, if you want to fix it, go ahead!''

*Die in real life 10 times and never ever be given birth ever again.

*Count to a million within 0.002763 seconds.
*Type "NO" in chat 276.3 thousand times without getting slowmode.

===Borderline {{PAGENAME}} ===
====Here is what you will be doing for the Baseline, do all of them in a row to be able to get success.====
Find the answer to 3n+1, count up to 2.7 million within 0.02763 seconds, do a 27.6 stud long jump with only 1 walkspeed rate and no jump, travel to all the countries and territories around the world just within 5 months, Type "B" in chat 2.7 million times in chat without getting slowmode.

After you are done with them all, here is the final challenge you will have to do.<blockquote>You will have to create 3 different difficulty/tower/class:</blockquote>

* One, create a class 21 difficulty without getting it deleted, thrice in a row (can't be on April Fools).
* Two, create a class 17 tower that is completely accurate
*Finally, after all the pain. You have reached the final challenge. That will be.. 
**'''CREATE A CLASS 23 IN THE MAIN JJT DIFFICULTY CHART, AND IT MUST HAVE ATLEAST 1 DIFFICULTY IN IT. DO NOT ASK FOR PERMISSION FROM YATA, SANJAY, ORBEN, TDE, OR ANY OTHER STAFF MEMBER OR ELSE YOU WILL LOSE THE CHALLENGE. IT MUST HAVE ATLEAST 5 DIFFICULTIES WITHIN 2 MONTHS OF THE RELEASE OF IT. THIS DOES NOT INCLUDE CUSTOM JJT DIFFICULTY CHARTS, ONLY THE OFFICIAL.'''

==Trivia== 
*The stylized name of '''TCC''' is using all capital letters, '''THE CRYSTAL CORE'''.
*There are 7 different types of the "2763" text from the BFDI found in this article, could you find all?
*This page used to have conjumbled zalgo text mess.
*<s>This is one of the few legendaries who does not have an official music</s>
**This is no longer the case, as the official music has been chosen.

*Back in around when this difficulty was created, this difficulty was temporarily the hardest ever difficulty on JJT. That is possibly one of the reasons why this is a Legendary.
*'''TCC''' and '''[[The Crystal HELL|TCH]]''' has a similar introduction to [[KLJY]], this was mostly to add more information.
