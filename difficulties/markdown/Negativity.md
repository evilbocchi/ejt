# Negativity

Negativity is the third difficulty on the Main Difficulty Chart, situated within Baseline Class Negative. It is considered unlosable and inconceivably easy, to the point where its easiness cannot be properly described. Negativity is the antipode of Penultimate and is so extreme that it cannot be compared to other difficulties.

This difficulty is often skipped in practice, as it is beyond trivial, and serves as a conceptual extreme on the chart.
