# Epinephrine

Epinephrine is a joke difficulty which was released alongside The Stronghold. There is only one tower in this difficulty, that being Nil's Ultimate Fate. This difficulty has previously been used in a few Event Realm events like reverse bridge. It is a reference to Epinephrine from REx:Reincarnated.
