Malevolent is a Peak Class 4 sub-difficulty of Malicious that comes after Autism, but before Building. This difficulty is categorized as Humanly Impossible, meaning that raw human skill is not enough to conquer it. Players would need to use assists such as modifying jump power and speed. Formerly regarded as the TAS limit, it represents a point where even tool-assisted runs struggle to complete the challenges. As human skill increases, more may become possible, but for now, this difficulty remains a major challenge.
