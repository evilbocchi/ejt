This difficulty is an ".exe" difficulty, which means it is an application that can modify your computer, or your screen.

Towers in this difficulty are not only difficult, but have unfair catches such as covering your screen with ">:D" signs. Due to this, obstacles are difficult and belong in class 7, as well as being incredibly unforgiving, often causing you to lose all your progress by even failing one jump.

If one would actually attempt a tower in this difficulty, they would need to practice doing obstacles blindfolded and with other unfair catches, as well as practicing the obstacles normally, and possibly even practicing some of the obstacles in real life. To complete a tower in this difficulty would be ''incredibly difficult'' and would be a renowned achievemnt for any obbyist. In fact, completing any obstacle in this difficulty would be an achievement that no obbyist has ever achieved.
