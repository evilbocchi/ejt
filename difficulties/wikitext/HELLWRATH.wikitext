It also has a sub-difficulty called [[File:Hellasious.png|30px]] [[Hellacious]]. It uses similar logic to [[File:Errorisation.png|30x30px]] '''[[Errorisation]],''' but it's way harder than it. It requires godlike obby skill, exploiting skill, and mechanical skill, but even with those abilities, you'll never get close to beating even the easiest obstacles of this, because as you heard already - it's a '''Class 9''' difficulty. It's simply way too hard to beat due to it's obstacles and what the difficulty does itself. 

The winpad is invisible, CanCollide false, and is only 0.05x0.05x0.05 studs in size, and the position cannot be found with scripts, as it will ban you. The position of the winpad is randomized aswell, and can be from 1k studs to 10m studs away from the spawn. You should've stayed in the lower classes, but now you will see your fate. 
==Icon Representation ==

===[[File:HELLWRATH.png|frameless|45x45px]] Current===
The icon is a giant evil face of anger, which at the same time looks like it's smiling, or simply - a >_<. The background is a really cursed error code made in Photomosh. 

===[[File:Hellwrathold.webp|frameless|45x45px]]  Old===
The icon is... comparable to the current one, but worse. The >_< is harder to notice, and there are white edges that theoretically border the reality. 

===[[File:KILL.jpg|frameless|45x45px]] '''HELLWRATH - Skyline'''===
Let's say, it's the exact same icon as the default one, but instead it's red and glows more. You can tell that this difficulty is tired of you...

===[[File:ALT.jpg|frameless|45x45px]] HELLWRATH - Errorline===
Okay, this is HELLWRATH Skyline version, but it's green, even more cursed with higher glowing and contrast. It was edited in Photomosh.

===[[File:IDKATTHISPOINT.jpg|frameless|45x45px]] HELLWRATH - Class 17 version (Unused)===
This icon is currently unused. It's a glitched purple >_<, it's pixelating, and you can compare it to a Thanos snap.<br />
==Catches== 

*You cannot detect the winpad's position with exploits.
*You cannot teleport yourself with exploits either, you can change your velocity though.
*You can't change your Walkspeed nor Jumppower.
*You don't have any access to the serverside section of the console.
*You can't change any properties of StarterPlayer.

The difficulty automatically detects if you broke any of those catches, if you attempt doing those you will get permabanned.

==Injection Types==
<span style="background:linear-gradient(90deg,#3366ff, #3366ff); -webkit-background-clip:text !important; -webkit-text-fill-color:transparent;">'''HELLWRATH'''</span> is a difficulty that will instantly get access to all your data and computer upon touching the portal to it or simply entering an obby of this difficulty. Despite it having access to all your data, IP Adrresses, and password, it will only inject viruses and errors into your device, and if you're mobile then you're screwed. Those are the types of errors it might inject into your computer. 

'''Names might be weird but who asked''' 

*'''Window Popupper''' is possibly the most simple virus, as it only makes fake errors and random windows open up, and so it could easily be blocked by a decent anti-virus.
*'''System Overloader''' will overload your system causing you to have heavy lag and could easily crash your pc even, even to irreparable damage. However it could be slowed down or even stopped by a really good anti-virus
*'''System Overheater''' is a really dangerous one, however it appears only in '''Peak''' and '''Skyline''' '''HELLWRATH''', it's still really dangerous, it could even put your own device on fire.
*'''File Deleter''' and no, it doesn't delete just some random images and stuff, it deletes important files that make your device functional, even one file removed from it could destroy your PC to irreparable damage, only appears in '''Skyline HELLWRATH'''.
*'''Screen Distorter''' and it's probably the only virus that doesn't attack your PC, but your screen that interrupts your gameplay by a lot, could easily be stopped though.
*'''Noise Player''', this doesn't just play quiet sounds. It even plays deafening and loud sounds that could burn out your speakers. Can be easily be prevented with a great antivirus. Gets louder depending on your difficulty position. (Baseline-Errorline)
*Add more, I guess.

==Obstacles of this difficulty==

===Obstacle Introduction===
Oh yeah, the most important part... the obstacles! You can't beat this difficulty AT ALL without beating the obstacles, which you definitely won't beat, won't even be close to. Beating those incomprehensibly large obstacles will sure destroy you, together with all those viruses in your device, huh? Well... let's see if you can pull out some godly exploits at the same time doing those obstacles and surviving the errors. 

But wait! You can't beat those obstacles without having any knowledge how to beat them!

===Obstacle Explanation===
First of all, you have to know how to exploit, if you don't - there's no way you're beating this difficulty. You need to know how to evade getting permbanned or affected with the catches and injections. You need a strong PC, and a really good anti-virus, but like REALLY strong one. 

After you do that, you'll need to know how to use your computer to delete the viruses from your computer. The anti-virus won't do everything for you, sometimes you'll have to do it manually. Every obstacles are different, some are in-game ones, that you need to beat with exploits, you cannot teleport! You have to change your velocity to land here. You might be able to beat Low '''HELLWRATH''' at this point, but after it, it's get more intense. 

I will not explain every obstacle, figure it out yourself, and find a way out, you got the most important information to beat this difficulty.

*Tower of Computer Breaking Errors (ToCBE)  ['''Mid HELLWRATH''']
*Tower of Fatal Computer Breaking (ToFCB)  ['''High HELLWRATH''']

==Trivia== 

*This difficulty uses computer-breaking glitches that can break your PC that it can even be irreparable, just like [[File:Errorisation.png|30x30px]] '''[[Errorisation]].'''
* This difficulty has a similar name to a difficulty called '''[[DeathWrath]]''', and was supposed to have the same design that it has, but YataDev instead decided to make it a >_< on an crazy cursed background. It is also inspired by the page [[File:Errorisation.png|30x30px]] '''[[Errorisation]], YataDev's''' first difficulty.
*'''HELLWRATH''' was meant to become a '''Legendary Difficulty''', however it failed to become one, it still became a '''Mythical Difficulty'''.
**It then became a '''Fabled Difficulty''' for a unknown reason.
***It then lost it probably because it didn't need to be a fabled.
****It them became Fabled again for an unknown reason.
*****It then lost Fabled once again.
*'''Yatadev''' thinks this is his best difficulty.
*This is (probably) one of the only difficulties that have obstacles above '''Skyline'''
**Many difficulties now have obstacles go to "Peripheral" which is above Skyline.
*All the icons were made in Photomosh.<br />

== Endings==
===<span style="background:linear-gradient(90deg,#00ff04,#00ff04); -webkit-background-clip:text !important; -webkit-text-fill-color:transparent;">'''Good Ending'''</span>===
You managed to succesfully beat '''HELLWRATH''', defeated the powerful computer-breaking errors, and the powerful obstacles. Your journey obviously doesn't end there though, there is a TON of difficulties before your final challenge.

===<span style="background:linear-gradient(90deg,#ff000a,#d80008); -webkit-background-clip:text !important; -webkit-text-fill-color:transparent;">'''Bad Ending'''</span>===
"Seriously? Did you flat brain seriously thought you would be capable of beating a difficulty with those kind of obstacles, and errors? You are very foolish, but it's your fault this is your fate. This might be a life lesson, except you are gone now."

===<span style="background:linear-gradient(90deg,#00ffec,#00ffec); -webkit-background-clip:text !important; -webkit-text-fill-color:transparent;">'''True Ending'''</span>===
You managed to beat '''HELLWRATH''', but you didn't leave. You decide to face your enemy again, but it's already defeated. You noticed a bright crystal, you decided to take it. Maybe you will need it to beat stronger difficulties. But it's time to go to the next difficulty, you can't stay here forever. 

===Another Ending===
You managed to beat '''HELLWRATH (the class 17 version). TBD'''


Anyways, if you did get the Good or True endings, go to either [[File:Hellasious.png|30px]] [[Hellacious]] or [[File:LOOP (NEW).jpg|frameless|30x30px]] [[LOOP]].
