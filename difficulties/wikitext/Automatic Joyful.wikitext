==Pre-Introduction==
'''''You probably either looking at the screen do absolutely nothing or AFK right now. You just beat''''' [[File:Walkthrough.png|30x30px]] '''''[[Walkthrough]] like less than a three quarters of a minute without pressing any single key. Well welcome to another unfailable difficulty [[File:{{PAGENAME}}2.png|30x30px]] {{PAGENAME}}'''''

==Introduction==
[[{{PAGENAME}}]] is a few Humanly Possible difficulty that is completely automatic which is located in the Upper gap of Class Negative. It has a rating of -20 and was put between [[File:Walkthrough.png|30x30px]] [[Walkthrough]] (-21) and [[File:Unlosable.png|30x30px]] [[Unlosable]] (-19).

This difficulty is still extremely easy, you can easily tell why, it’s literally an automatic difficulty with obstacles that required absolutely no effort whatsoever.

[[{{PAGENAME}}]] has a usage of a lot of mechanic and contraption with a very straightforward yet fun twist. It uses a lot of different Client Objects to not be too repetitive along with very risky conveyors ride but still ensure that you cannot fail at any point.

This difficulty is harder by x1.22 times than [[File:Walkthrough.png|30x30px]] [[Walkthrough]]. Compare this to the previous difficulty is like comparing [[File:Restful3.png|30x30px]] [[Restful]] to [[File:Ifinitely-Winsome.png|30x30px]] [[Ifinity]] which is a very small gap between them.

*Fast conveyors, in the end there is an elevator that bounces you into the winpad
*Conveyors, but you have to wait 15 seconds to reach the elevator that bounces you to the winpad.
*Conveyors, but you have to wait 25 seconds to reach the elevator that bounces you to the winpad.

===Extended Obstacles===
Welcome to the Route of Boringness. This do not exist in the old {{PAGENAME}} page. Completing these trials will send you to [[Joyful]] immediately. There are currently 9 obstacles here. Feel free to add more obstacles into this section related to the first nine obstacles here.

*Stand on a part but every 5 seconds there is a 15% it will launch you up to the winpad.
*Play an automatic walkthrough of a [[Joyful]] monolith (but you can skip it).
*Conveyors that moves you to an x-launcher which launches you up to the sky, then falls down to the rotated x-launcher which sends you to the winpad.
*Launches/bounces yourself up until you have enough momentum to launches you to the winpad
*Complete all [[Joyful]] obstacles, but every obstacles are done automatically
*Jump onto the fake winpad when you supposed to not jump for 15 seconds, jumping into the fall winpad will reset and increases the timer by 5 seconds. (There is a sign somewhere near the obstacles hinting that you shouldn't jump).
====Others====
*The winpad is 100 studs above you. The elevator will bounce you up with a random heights from 20 to 200.
*Conveyors to a vertical shover that shoves you into the winpad
*A complex conveyors contraption that bounce you up at the end
*[[Walkthrough]] an Automatic Joyful obstacles
