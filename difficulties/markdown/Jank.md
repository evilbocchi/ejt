# Jank

Jank is a sub-difficulty of Nil, located near the peak phase of Nil in Class 4. It is known for its unfair, uncomfortable obstacles and heavy reliance on RNG, making it extremely challenging even for the best obbyists. The difficulty is the successor to Nil and precedes The Heart of Void and Error.

Towers in Jank feature instakill floors, unfair wallhops, and tight squeezes, often requiring TAS or special tools to complete. The icon is a glowing version of the Nil icon, with a brighter top and outlined design. Jank is infamous for its uncomfortable gameplay and is a major milestone for those seeking the most extreme challenges.
