It also had one sub-difficulty, called [[File:Stone.png|30px]] [[Excavation Chain/Stone-Emerald|Stone]], in the excavation chain.

[[File:Glee Difficulty.png|frameless|30x30px]] <span style="background:linear-gradient(90deg,magenta,pink); -webkit-background-clip:text !important; -webkit-text-fill-color:transparent;">'''Glee'''</span> used to be located in '''Mid Class 0''' (before TDEx), as a successor to '''[[w:c:jtohs-custom-chart:Tranquil|Tranquil]]''' (JCC), and meanwhile was a predecessor of [[w:c:jtohs-custom-chart:Heavenlike|Heavenlike]]. However, this difficulty was transferred from JCC to JJT, and will reside here from now onwards.

Due to its placement, essentially anyone can beat this difficulty. It consists of very basic obstacles, which are extremely easy and you will most likely get bored while playing this difficulty. You should move into something harder, like [[File:EffortlesslessIconOoIDC.png|frameless|30x30px]] '''[[Effortlessless]]''', or maybe even [[File:EffortlessDifficulty.jpg|frameless|30x30px]] '''[[w:c:jtoh:Effortless|Effortless]]''', or you can just stay on this difficulty.

There is a magenta star in the bottom left and top right corner, and there is a smaller magenta star to the right of Glee’s smile.

==Continuing on from this point==
Well, what can I say? You’ve passed [[File:Glee Difficulty.png|frameless|30x30px]] <span style="background:linear-gradient(90deg,magenta,pink); -webkit-background-clip:text !important; -webkit-text-fill-color:transparent;">'''Glee'''</span>, it isn’t really that much of a achievement. Move onto [[File:New flowerness image1.png|30px]] [[Flowerness]], I guess.
