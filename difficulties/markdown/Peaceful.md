Peaceful is a Low Class 1 difficulty represented by a light greyish purple color with a smile. It's easier than Playful (its sub-difficulty) and Magnificent, but harder than TooEasy. Obstacles in this difficulty are elementary and should be easily accomplished by everyone. Peaceful encourages players to start jumping and complete basic obstacles, moving beyond just existing.
