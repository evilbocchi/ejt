# QR Code

QR Code is a High Class 8 difficulty created by TasmanianRex. It is notable for its unique theme, with the icon representing a typical QR code. This difficulty is the first made by its creator and has a humorous origin. Obstacles in QR Code are nearly impossible to build in sandboxes with space limits, and the difficulty itself was introduced in July 2021. The QR code on the icon leads to a rickroll, and the difficulty cannot have a proper decal due to Roblox's image policies. QR Code once belonged to Class 12 but is now recognized as a distinct, high-level challenge.
