# Undocumented

Undocumented is the second difficulty of the Liminality Chain, with the other two in the chain being called Mysterious and Denial. It goes between those other difficulties in the chain.

This difficulty revolves around extremely difficult obstacles, which are very difficult to construct in a tower, let alone complete. You would need tools like exploits in order to even stand a chance against Undocumented.

This would have a very high tier rating (around tier 3000?) as well as a high Kol Metris rating (maybe |530|?), although neither of those measurements are precise in this format.
