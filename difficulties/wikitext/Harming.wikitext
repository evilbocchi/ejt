'''[[File:Harming.svg|30x30px]] <span style="color:#FF0000">Harming</span>''' is a [[:Category:Class 2|<span style="color:#FF0000">'''Mid Class 2'''</span>]] '''[[:Category:Revived|<span style="color:#3333AA">Revived Sub-Difficulty</span>]]''' of [[File:MenacingDifficulty.png|30px]] [[Menacing|<span style="color:red">'''Menacing'''</span>]]. The difficulty comes before EToH's {{Class2Difficulties|Challenging}} [https://jtoh.fandom.com/wiki/Challenging Challenging] difficulty so if you want to proceed onto the next difficulty, you must be able to conquer this sub-difficulty.

<span style="color:#FF0000">'''Harming'''</span> incorporates techniques typically seen in [[File:MenacingDifficulty.png|30px]] [[Menacing|<span style="color:red">'''Menacing'''</span>]] and other slightly easier difficulties. But don't underestimate the difficulty as it for sure can drive someone mad to the point where they may cause harm to themselves. This difficulty is often a roadblock for the average obbyist as it takes some serious dedication to overcome. It is pretty much the gateway to {{Class2Difficulties|Challenging}} [https://jtoh.fandom.com/wiki/Challenging Challenging] so a tough challenge is to be expected. If this difficulty was on the difficulty chart, it would probably be High to Peak Difficult.

This difficulty had been revived more than once and even had a different version located in Class 7 called '''Hyper-Harming''' which now doesn't exist anymore.

=== <span style="background:linear-gradient(90deg, red, white); -webkit-background-clip:text !important; -webkit-text-fill-color:transparent;"> Former Placement </span> ===
This difficulty was formerly placed between {{Class2Difficulties|Wait}} [[Wait|<span style="color:#FFFFFF">'''Wait'''</span>]] and {{Class2Difficulties|Noob Babass}} ''[[Noob Babass]]'', both of which are not included in the main difficulty chart anymore.

==Icon Representation==
<tabber>
Current=
<center>[[File:Harming.svg|60x60px]]</center>
It is represented with a simple red background, with a sad emoticon and a dark red #. It’s pretty simple, some might even say it looks a bit plain.
|-|
Alternate=
<center>[[File:HarmingUnofficial.png|60x60px]]</center>
This is a lot different. The alternate icon is a maroon radial gradient background. On it, there's a -~- face with a tear in its right eye, and the same red # from the current icon.
