{{BetterQuote|text=<span style="color: green;text-shadow:0 2px 6px green;font-family: Arial"> Impressive. You have reached Errorisation, on this endless majestic Difficulty Chart. Have you thought of how good you actually are? You did something no other human was capable of. Humans have not even reached Class 4, yet you're in Class 8, right here and right now. Instead of going back, you decided to dedicate all your effort, and here we are. Maybe you're capable of defeating this one too, but I'll be real, you shouldn't celebrate early. You see, this difficulty is completely different from the surronding difficulties, something you're not prepared for. This is where you will need something more than just obby experience. I wish you the best of luck, but you've probably heard of this sentence, we know it won't matter anyway."|quoter=YataDev}}

==What is [[File:ErrorisationAlt.png|frameless|40x40px]] Errorisation?==
[[File:ErrorisationAlt.png|frameless|25x25px]] '''Errorisation''' is a High Class 8 difficulty succeeding [[File:Qr-codedifficulty.png|30x30px]] [[QR Code]] but preceding [[File:Screenshot 2023-04-28 at 22.00.59.png|frameless|30x30px]] [[Esoteric]]. '''Errorisation''' is not just hard, but it's also very annoying. The catches are the reason why this difficulty is so annoying. You could take this difficulty as [[File:HELLWRATH.png|frameless|25x25px]] [[HELLWRATH]] but easier. Both of these difficulties follow a lot of similarities. '''Errorisation''' is capable of accessing files and data on your computer and injecting malware and other viruses. They are meant to interrupt your gameplay, and to annoy you. So it's not just obby skills, but also mechanic and computer skills. Also you're screwed if you play this difficulty on a mobile device, because it'll just make this difficulty like Class 9. This difficulty is so hard that it would make you literally scream your literal gut out of your own mouth just by looking at the obstacles. 

==Icon Representation==
There are 4 icons for this difficulty. The reason why is that is because there was a vote for the new '''Errorisation''' icon. To not make the other icons go to waste, they were listed here as well.

===[[File:ErrorisationRevamp.png|frameless|35x35px]] Current===
It is a green error screen that was so giltched out, it  caused this difficulty to be just a few black-green lines  and some other colors. Modified in Photomosh, it is a more complex version of the simpler icon.

===[[File:Errorisation.png|frameless|35x35px]] Former/Old===
This icon has most likely the funniest story, as it's a wall from one of the dimensions from old [https://www.roblox.com/games/7254364629/CLASS-1-DBG-Revamp Difficulty Button Game]. It is a simple glitched image mostly green and black, but with a red line.

===[[File:ErrorisationAlt.png|frameless|35x35px]] Simpler===
It is a simpler version of the current icon without other colors, thus the only colors here are green and black.

===[[File:ErrorisationAlternative.png|frameless|35x35px]] Alternative===
Alternative icon for this difficulty, which is more similar to the old icon but better.

==Catches==

*You're unable to set your Jump Power at all.
*Every 8 seconds, a deadly trojan is injected to your computer.
*You cannot delete nor skip the obstacles, or else they'll become unpredictable.

==Trivia==

* This is the first ever difficulty made by [[User:YataDev|YataDev]].
*This difficulty got a revamp on April 21 of 2022.
*A buffed version of Errorisation is [[File:HELLWRATH.png|frameless|35x35px]] [[HELLWRATH]], which is harder than this but works quite similar.
**Adding on to this, this is one of the many difficulties that have to do with errors in some way.

==Continuing from this Point==
Amazing done, you have successfully made it out alive from this glitched difficulty. Really great job. You deserve a lot of congratulations for beating this difficulty. Now it's time to go to [[File:GodlikeDiff.PNG|frameless|30x30px]] [[Godlike]] or [[File:Screenshot 2023-04-28 at 22.00.59.png|frameless|30x30px]] [[Esoteric]]. Good luck.
