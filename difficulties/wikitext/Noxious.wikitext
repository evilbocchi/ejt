==What is [[File:Noxious.png|frameless|35x35px]] <span style="background:linear-gradient(blue,cyan); -webkit-background-clip:text !important; -webkit-text-fill-color:transparent;"><span style="text-shadow: blue 0px 0.5px 6px;">Noxious</span>?==
<span style="background:linear-gradient(blue,black,blue); -webkit-background-clip:text !important; -webkit-text-fill-color:transparent;"><span style="text-shadow: blue 0px 0.5px 6px;">'''Noxious'''</span></span> is a Class 4 sub-difficulty, located at the top of the class. It takes place after [[File:Immeasurable-0.png|frameless|30x30px]] [[W:c:jtohs-hardest-towers:Immeasurable|Immeasurable]], but before [[File:Malicious.png|frameless|30x30px]] [[W:c:jtohs-hardest-towers:Malicious|Malicious]]. It is also the last difficulty until the last JHT difficulty. Obstacles of this difficulty require numerous mastered techniques, as well as luck. Towers of this difficulty are impossible to beat without any tools. 

Verifying an obstacle of this difficulty is nearly impossible, and will take a huge amount of attempts.  

==Icon Representation ==
[[File:Noxious.png|frameless|25x25px]] <span style="background:linear-gradient(blue,cyan); -webkit-background-clip:text !important; -webkit-text-fill-color:transparent;"><span style="text-shadow: blue 0px 0.5px 6px;">'''Noxious'''</span></span> icon is a black to blue gradient, with the dominant color of blue. There is also a dark blue border/outline around the icon. It is not complicated, but not too simple either.

==Continuing from this Point==
I don't know how you did that, but you sure as hell must be a great obbyist. Or you just used exploits. Doesn't matter now, as it's time to continue and continue onto [[File:Malicious.png|frameless|30x30px]] [[W:c:jtohs-hardest-towers:Malicious|Malicious]]. You will need a lot of game experience and luck, if you want to try to complete a tower of that difficulty.
