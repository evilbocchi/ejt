# Killjoying

Killjoying is a low-mid Class 5, humanly impossible difficulty in the XD chain, serving as a super-buffed variant of Unreal. It is harder than Neutralize and is the fourth hardest difficulty in the XD chain. The icon is based on the old Unreal icon, with alternative versions inspired by the new Unreal icon.

Obstacles in Killjoying are so difficult that completion is impossible without TAS. The difficulty is notorious for its extreme challenge and is considered a major milestone for those attempting the hardest content in the chart.
