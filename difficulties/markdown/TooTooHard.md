# TooTooHard

TooTooHard is a Class 10 difficulty that is physically impossible. It defies the ROBLOX physics engine, making it impossible to beat, even with tool assistance or exploits. TooTooHard is a buffed version of TooHard or WHY, and represents a point where even the most ambitious towers cannot be completed.

Obstacles in this difficulty are so extreme that attempting them would crash the game or make progress impossible. TooTooHard marks the boundary where challenges become completely unbuildable and unplayable.
