# Apocalyptic

Apocalyptic is a Low Class 5 humanly impossible difficulty, and has had many difficulties before and after it, due to being one of the original Class 5 difficulties. It is much harder than Invigorating although slightly easier than Destructive.

Apocalyptic has two sub-difficulties called Eternal Outrage and Gar-Insane, from the dark depths of being lost due to the TooChain's removal. This difficulty is, as its name suggests, absolutely ludicrously impossible. There is literally no way you can actually attempt this legitimately. Try as you might, there is no point in attempting to tackle this difficulty, as it features obstacles that you can only complete in your dreams, not even completable by TAS without hacks.
