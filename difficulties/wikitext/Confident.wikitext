==What is [[File:Confidence.png|frameless|31x31px]] <span style="background:linear-gradient(gray,gray); -webkit-background-clip:text !important; -webkit-text-fill-color:transparent;"><span style="text-shadow: gray 0px 0.5px 6px;">'''Confident?'''==
[[File:Confidence.png|frameless|31x31px]] '''Confident''' is a Class 3 difficulty, that was originally made to be in the JCC wiki, as [[File:Enigmatic Old.jpeg|frameless|30x30px]] [[Enigmatic/JCC|Unfathomable]], but has since been ported to the '''JToH’s Joke Towers Wiki''', as '''Confident'''. This was before its deletion, however, which was literally just a few hours after its creation, due to it unfortunately being created a few hours before the Difficulty Purge. Now, [[File:Enigmatic.gif|frameless|30x30px]] [[Enigmatic]] is the JJT [[w:c:jtohs-custom-chart:Unfathomable|Unfathomable]].

This difficulty was placed as the absolute borderline between human possibility and human impossibility, but no longer is it the borderline. Still, this difficulty requires a very small amount of luck, but extremely precise movements, and strict timings, where even a small mishap could send you all the way down to a pit of instakills. Hence, it has a placement after {{Class3Difficulties|Eternalized}}[[Eternal]] (also as a sub difficulty of it), and before {{Class3Difficulties|Unreal}} [[w:c:jtoh:Unreal|Unreal]].

For preperation, one should make sure to finish up some lower {{Class3Difficulties|Eternalized}}[[Eternal]] difficulty towers unfinished, and make sure to do lots of practice as you will need it.

==Trivia==
More trivia facts will be added soon, since most of these are invalid.
*This difficulty was previously from JCC, as Unfathomable, but it is no longer the JJT version of that difficulty.
*This was the first Class 3 normal difficulty that isn’t actually a JToH difficulty, but that changed.
*This was inspired by [[Nightmare]].

==Continuing on from this point==
Good job, I guess. You’ve gone and beaten a tower that has a difficulty that is soon to be possible. My GGs are with you. Have a nice, well deserved break with your family, and go touch grass as you will likely need to have a break after completing such a daunting challenge. When you’re ready, move onto {{Class3Difficulties|Unreal}} [[w:c:jtoh:Unreal|Unreal]].
