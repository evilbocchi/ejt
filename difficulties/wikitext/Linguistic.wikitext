Hello there, reader. You may have noticed that this difficulty has a very protracted wall of text. Because of your inquisitiveness, your brain has decided to focus on the text since you began reading it. It is a quintessential disaster, and it is perfectly fine. Your brain opts to continue reading the text because, as aforementioned, it is perfectly normal to be curious about a specific action. In any case, as you read this, you may be beginning to wonder, what essentially is this difficulty? This difficulty, you see, uses multifaceted phrases to make itself impractical, and due to the complex logic that cannot be perceived through words, it is undefinable. Unclassified may not be the right word, seeing as classes are not always the most appropriate way to describe a difficulty like this. Your consciousness causes you to wonder the entire difficulty. The simple answer to your enquiry is that this difficulty is superfluous. It should never have been read in the initial place. But since you've read this far, you already know what it is used for. This difficulty is theoretically impossible to beat, but it cannot be classified simply. The logic has already been explained; it employs linguistic terms and complex logic to render itself untenable. To solve this problem, you would necessitate a brain with at least a few billion IQ points. Let's have a thought test. You recognize yourself in the distant future, perhaps a few thousand years later. Even though technology and intelligence have increased exponentially, and the Kardashev scale has most likely reached point 2, you have been unable to overcome this difficulty. Let us now fast forward a few thousand years. The technology is even more advanced, possibly raising the Kardashev scale to around point 3, but you were unable to overcome this difficulty. In theory, you could argue, "but wait, since this difficulty requires enourmous intelligence to figure out, wouldn't it mean it's classified?" The short answer is no. Even though casual difficulties are based on obstacles designed to simulate by engines, more specifically Roblox Studio. This difficulty, on the other hand, is intelligence-based rather than skill-based. As a result, it may be classified differently depending on your intelligence, and thus it is unclassified. One might then wonder, "Why is this a difficulty at all? What is the point of using linguistic units to make itself difficult, when difficulties were designed to be recreated in Roblox Studio? ". It has never been specified that a difficulty must be used on the Roblox engine, as logic begins to fade out above Class 13. Unclassified stores various types of obstacles that are either completely illogical or completely unique. As a result, this difficulty exists so that it can be overcome based on one's intelligence.
