# 16

**16** is an unclassified difficulty centered around the number 16. It was originally created in celebration of Vira's birthday on September 10th. Initially made for Vira's 14th birthday, it has been updated each year to reflect Vira's passing birthdays, previously being known as 14 and 15.

This difficulty frequently features celebrations of Vira and related birthday material. Each year, the difficulty updates to a new number, and for September 10, 2025 to September 10, 2026, it is centered around 16, with a range from Class 6 to Class 16.

With each passing year, the difficulty becomes progressively harder, reflecting higher classes and more challenging obstacles. For this reason, 16 is considered an unclassified event difficulty, as it is an annual occurrence. As of now, this difficulty has surpassed The Human Limit, making it humanly impossible regardless of its range.
