== What is '''Exist'''?==
'''Exist''' is a difficulty so incredibly easy that before you even turned on your computer, you already won! This difficulty is so much more of a joke then Win because you don't even need to go through a portal or even join any game in order to win. Just exist for 0.00000001 nanoseconds and, bam, you won! Even if your sleeping, falling, doing anything your winning.

''Exist is the first difficulty that requires you to exist in order to win. Obviously.'' 

== Icon ==
The icon varies. Usually it's white with Exist in code font, maybe it's in a rainbow blocky font with colored lines, and also in a square. The most common one however, is just a white rectangle with rainbow bold text saying "Exist".

==Obstacles in '''Exist'''==
*Have an existence rank of exactly 1.
*Have 1 Planck time of existence.
*Exist in reality where this difficulty is.

==Trivia==
*This is theoretically impossible to lose, as you've already won it. Coercive or whatever logic is not accepted in Exist's domain.
*The previous fact is false. If you use a time machine and stop your parents from meeting eachother, you will cease to exist and will have lost the difficulty. If you don't have the time machine, then you won't ever lose this. (Why would you do that anyway?)
*You beat this difficulty the second you were born, you beat skip when you joined Roblox and you beat win when you entered the portal.
