# Denial

Denial is the final difficulty of the Liminality Chain, following Undocumented and preceding Aleph-Something. As the name suggests, players are denied from beating this difficultyâ€”it is physically impossible. Denial originated from The Difficulty Machine: Revamp, where it was placed at Class 36. It is exponentially harder than the actual limit for tiers, making it a true test of endurance and skill.
