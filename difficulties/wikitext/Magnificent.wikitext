[[File:Magnificent Current.png|30x30px]] '''Magnificent''' is a Peak Class 1 Revived Classic Difficulty, that sits between [[File:BabyingSDC.png|30px]] [[Babying]] and [[File:EffortlesslessIconOoIDC.png|30x30px]] [[Effortlessless]] (or [[File:Facile1.png|30x30px]] [[Facile]]) . Obstacles are extremely easy, so easy that you won’t feel any sort of challenge in this difficulty. 

===History===
This classic difficulty was created on November 19, 2020 by [[User:SodafizzIGuess|<bdi>SodafizzIGuess</bdi>]], placed between Babying and Effortlessless. It also had one sub difficulty, being Diaphanous, although it never actually existed. 

On the 9th of November 2021, at 1:37 am (according to Fandom), the difficulty was deleted. A few hours later, the page was recreated, as an empty page, and was deleted later, at 4:30 pm, on the same day. Even later that day, the page was recreated '''again''' as a blank page, and was deleted at 8:28 pm on the same day.

About 8 months later, the difficulty was revived by The Difficulty Enthusiast, and that is the page you’re reading right now.
{{NewHeader-Dynamic||text=Icon Representations}}
===New===
[[File:Magnificent Current.png|center|frameless|60x60px]]
This icon is more complex than the alternate one. There is a sky blue background, with a light blue border. In the sky blue background is the blueberry background from the old icon, but with 5% transparency, and in the middle is a ‘:)’ emoticon.
===Old===
[[File:MagnificentBlueberries.jpg|center|frameless|60x60px]]
It’s just a blueberry background, that’s it. Just the average Classic difficulty icon.
===Alternate===
[[File:Magv3.png|center|frameless|60x60px]]
cat.
===Simplified Chart===
[[File:MagnificentSDC.png|center|frameless|60x60px]]
It's three blueberries on a light blue background with a blue leaf. It's simple, just like most of the Simplified difficulty chart.
