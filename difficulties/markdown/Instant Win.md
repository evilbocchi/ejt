# Instant Win

Instant Win is the finale of Class Negative. The concept is that the difficulty is so trivial that it results in an instant completion with zero effort. Obstacles are essentially non-existentâ€”completing this difficulty is as simple as waiting a fraction of a second.

The icon is a flat blue background with a sleepy "-_-" white emoticon in the center. Instant Win is famous for being the first class finale and is one of the most well-known difficulties in JJT. After completing Instant Win, players are encouraged to move on to Millisecondless or something harder.
