Mischievous is a mid Class 5 difficulty located between Dissonant and Eldritch. It sits at the extreme limit of physically possible and physically impossible, bordering on humanly impossible. Obstacles in this difficulty are almost entirely luck-based and nearly beyond pixel and frame perfect, requiring extreme skill, tools, and patience. Only robots or AIs could realistically complete towers of this difficulty.
