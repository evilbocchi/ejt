<span style="background:linear-gradient(90deg,lime,white,lime); -webkit-background-clip:text !important; -webkit-text-fill-color:transparent;">'''Undocumented'''</span> is the second difficulty of the [[:Category:Liminality Chain|Liminality Chain]], with the other 2 in the chain being called [[File:Mysterious2.png|25x25px]] [[Mysterious]] and [[File:Liminesque.png|frameless|25x25px]] [[Denial]]. Speaking of which, it goes between those other difficulties in the chain.

This difficulty revolves around extremely difficult obstacles, which are very difficult to construct in a tower, let alone complete. You would need tools like exploits in order to even stand a chance against '''Undocumented'''.

This would have a very high tier rating (around tier 3000?) as well as a high Kol Metris rating (maybe |530|?), although neither of those measurements are precise in this format.
==Icon Representation==
Undocumented’s icon is represented with many pixelated lime and forest green splotches, and a inner layer of greenish teal and dark greenish teal splotches. There is a smudged white diamond on the top left and bottom right corners of the icon, and a light green theta icon with a inner lime outline and a dark green outline surrounding the other outline. Finally, there is a ring of many, many extremely thin white droplets.
