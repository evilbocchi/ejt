[[File:Ifinitely-Winsome.png|30px]] '''Ifinity''', the first ever revived [[:Category:Class Negative|Class Negative]] difficulty, and probably the only one thanks to it's quality, exists in the peak sector of [[:Category:Class Negative|Class Negative]], past [[File:Restful2.png|frameless|25x25px]] ''[[Restful]]'', yet before [[File:Instantwin.png|frameless|25x25px]] [[Instant Win]], the first instantaneous difficulty and the official chart’s beginning. It was previously a ''Low Class Negative'' difficulty, located inbetween {{Class-1Difficulties|Negativity|25px}} [[Negativity]] and [[File:Unimpossible New.png|25x25px|link=Unimpossible]] [[Unimpossible]]. This could be considered an unrebirth variation of the difficulty known as [[File:Screen Shot 2020-08-10 at 9.50.46 AM.png|frameless|30x30px]] [[Infinity]], but it is not. 

To reiterate, there is practically no way to lose this difficulty, as it is below [[File:Instantwin.png|frameless|25x25px]] [[Instant Win]], meaning one attempting to lose such a difficulty as '''Ifinity''' would be sorely disappointed. There is no tier rating for this difficulty, and a Kol Metris rating is ~|10|.

It is the same as the current icon, but there are cracks in the infinity symbol, the notder is darker, and the infinity symbol is darker.

==Trivia ==
*The first time this was revived, it was not meant to be revived, but someone recreated the page, and the original creator decided to revive it for absolutely no reason.
*This had another version, located in Mid Class 3, called [[File:Galactical Limitation.png|frameless|30x30px]] ''Galactic''.
**It was deleted for author request.
*To elaborate on the statement known as 'the first ever revived [[:Category:Class Negative|Class Negative]] difficulty', this difficulty was previously deleted by [[User:YataDev|YataDev]] due to low quality and unfittingness, however someone revived this difficulty and here we are.
*This was the original replacement for [[File:Na.png|frameless|30x30px]] ''N/A'', which was in {{Class-1Difficulties|Negativity}} [[Negativity]]'s spot.
*This is the second(?) difficulty to have notes. The first used to be {{Class-1Difficulties|Negativity}} <s>[[Negativity]]</s>, but Negativity’s revamp removed the notes. This is now the first difficulty to use it.

== Continuing on from this point==
One who has beaten this difficulty will most likely have already completed the next difficulty whether they have wanted to or not. It is advised they go onto a difficulty much further up in the [[Main Difficulty Chart|Difficulty Chart]], such as {{Class1Difficulties|Easy|25px}} [[w:c:jtoh:Easy|Easy]]... or if you STILL want to continue this class... go to [[File:Instantwin.png|frameless|25x25px]] [[Instant Win]]
