# No

No is a difficulty that is assigned to towers that are harder than WHY difficulty, but easier than DEATH. It is represented with a stone gray fading into black, a stone gray outline, and a white ".-." in the middle.

Obstacles in this difficulty have broken logic and jumps that can't usually be done. These obstacles are either no longer possible due to updates or only possible with TAS. This is the first difficulty that has humanly impossible jumps (9+), so from this point towers cannot be properly rated.
