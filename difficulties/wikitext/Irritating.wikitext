== Introduction - [[File:irritating square.PNG|30px]] <span style="color:#B00000">Irritating</span> ==
[[File:irritating square.PNG|30px]] <span style="color:#B00000">'''Irritating'''</span> is a sub-difficulty of {{Class2Difficulties|Challenging}} [[w:c:jtoh:Challenging|Challenging]], residing between {{Class2Difficulties|Challenging}} {{jtoh|Challenging}} and {{Class2Difficulties|Maniacal}} [[Maniacal]] with a rating of 5.25. This difficulty is in class 2 which means that it is humanly possible. However, it is difficult for the average Obbyist to complete towers of this difficulty. Using this logic, the average MEGA FUN OBBY player will struggle and potentially give up after a few jumps on this difficulty. Consider beating a tower of this difficulty an achievement.

[[File:irritating square.PNG|30px]] <span style="color:#B00000">'''Irritating'''</span> is one of the transitions from {{Class2Difficulties|Challenging}} [[w:c:jtoh:Challenging|Challenging]] to {{Class2Difficulties|Intense}} [[w:c:jtoh:Intense|Intense]]. [[File:irritating square.PNG|30px]] <span style="color:#B00000">Irritating</span> has a rating of 5.25, this sub-difficulty is nested within the borders of low-mid {{Class2Difficulties|Challenging}} [[w:c:jtoh:Challenging|Challenging]]. This difficulty is usually beaten because of tower cleanups, as jumping from low to mid gives more skill than taking it slow and moving every segment up.               

The recommended towers to beat in this difficulty are [[w:c:jtoh:Steeple of Climbing|Steeple of Climbing]] and [[w:c:jtoh:Tower of Break It, Buy It|Tower of Break It, Buy It]]. These two towers are excellent for skill progression as Steeple of Climbing is a tower that is near mid {{Class2Difficulties|Challenging}} [[w:c:jtoh:Challenging|Challenging]], usually towers in mid are completed after one or two easier towers of the same difficulty are beaten. If you are going from a highest of peak {{Class2Difficulties|Difficult}} [[w:c:jtoh:Difficult|Difficult]], you may try [[w:c:jtoh:Tower of Break It, Buy It|Tower of Break It, Buy It]] as it is modern and can prepare you for harder and more modern towers, the only downside though is ToBIBI is all the way in Zone 6, which is very far from the early areas of JToH.

GG, this is a difficulty that most Roblox players struggle on, so if you successfully beat a tower of this difficulty you have proven yourself to be an above-average Roblox player in terms of obbies.
