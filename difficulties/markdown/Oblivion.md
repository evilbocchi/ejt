# Oblivion

Oblivion is a Class 6 sub-difficulty and one of the last humanly impossible challenges. Every obstacle relies on glitches and movements that are beyond human capability, requiring players to perform actions that are nearly impossible to replicate intentionally. Even the best obbyists have little chance of success, as Oblivion utilizes confusing tactics and illogical physics.
