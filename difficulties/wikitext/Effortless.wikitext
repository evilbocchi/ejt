{{Difficulty|Effortless|20px}} <span id="Effortless">[[Effortless]]</span> was the previous easiest [[difficulty]] in '''EToH''' before its deletion. It was represented with a color more darker green than [[Easy]]. Towers in this difficulty contained extremely simplistic, and mostly basic obstacles, such as Tower of Slight Unhappiness.

{{Header|History}}
There had only been one {{Difficulty|Effortless|20px}} <span id="Effortless">[[Effortless]]</span> tower ever in '''EToH''', which was [[Tower of Slight Unhappiness]] by {{PlayerName|Gammattor}}. [[Tower of One Equals Zero]] was also considered to be {{Difficulty|Effortless|20px}} <span id="Effortless">[[Effortless]]</span> before, but that was no longer the case once {{Difficulty|Effortless|20px}} <span id="Effortless">[[Effortless]]</span> got removed.
