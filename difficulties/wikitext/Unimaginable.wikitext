==What is <span style="color:#FF0000">'''Unimaginable'''</span>?==
<span style="color:#FF0000">'''Unimaginable'''</span> is a difficulty assigned to towers harder than [[TARTARUS|<span style="color:#c2dff1">'''TARTARUS'''</span>]], but easier than {{RainbowLink|Omega}}. It is currently represented with a red square with three white question marks (<code>???</code>) on a black to dark red gradient box. This is the estimated difficulty where theoretical physical possibility can go before falling into the no-go zone. These obstacle courses seemingly go against the laws of Roblox. Any attempt to beat an Unimaginable tower without any exploits is futile.

==Towers with <span style="color:#FF0000">'''Unimaginable'''</span>==
*ToBLUE - [[Tower of Ballambangjang Litigiousnesses Ubiquitousnesses Earthlinesses]]
*E - [[Eclipse]]
*FoUPaT - [[Facility of Ungraspable Physics and Techniques]]
*ToAC - Tower of Absolute(?) Cataclysm(?) (lost media tower)

==Trivia== 
*This difficulty was originally called ''Shouldn't Be Possible'', and was later changed to <span style="color:#FF0000">'''Unimaginable'''</span> per the results of a community poll in EHT's official Discord server.
