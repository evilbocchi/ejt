==[[File:Satan Tartarus Lucifer Void.png|50px]] Satan Tartarus Lucifer Void==
'''Satan Tartarus Lucifer Void''' (or STLV for short) is a Class 8 normal difficulty which succeeds [[File:Communism better.png|30px]] [[COMMUNISM]] and preceeds [[File:Qr-codedifficulty.png|30px]] [[QR Code]]. '''Satan Tartarus Lucifer Void''' is comprised of 4 sections; Satan, Tartarus, Lucifer and Void. You'll see them later.

Of course, the devil's difficulty isn't this low, they are a god after all. This difficulty has been significantly nerfed by the 4 aforementioned hellified creatured so that its easy enough to have you attempt this but be tortured helplessly without end. Even then, you shouldn't be attempting this difficulty nor the many before this one. They are impossible in everyway. So logically you shouldn't reach this point. But even if you are skilled enough to be able to beat some of the last few difficulties, this one will be your end, but why should this one be different? Well, it was the end of Class 11 previously, so your limit should be close.

==Icon Representation==
===[[File:Satan Tartarus Lucifer Void.png|50px]] New Icon===
[[File:Satan Tartarus Lucifer Void.png|30px]] <b>Satan Tartarus Lucifer Void</b>'s Icon, the new one is completely different to the old one. First, its a circular Black to Red gradient, on the top left is a red XD and the bottom left has a red X_X, mostly referring to CHAOS XD and DEADLY TUBULAR DEATH, but that isn't known (yea, even the creator doesn't know). The main part is the DEVIL. It has 2 shining, evil eyes without a mouth and 2 horn that go off, like a real devil. Below is 4 texts with different colors. All of them say "The Devil is waiting...". All the text uses Ed Garamond, which is now my favorite font (not anymore).

===[[File:Screen Shot 2020-09-25 at 3.37.53 PM.png|50px]] Old Icon===
The old Icon is represented by a brown background, in the middle is Memory from the Roblox game: Piggy, which is many times more popular than JToH. and also in the center is a white XD, nothing too complicated but something slightly cringy ngl.

==Obstacles==
Due to Great Rebalancings constantly changing the obstacles and because nobody wants to update them, there is no definite obstacle range for STLV. However, the jumps that could be here range from at minimum 200 to 400, depending on how hard you think this difficulty is. For the sake of obstacles however, let's just say its from 333 to 366 for the sake of simplicity.

The real part that is definite is the forms of [[File:Satan Tartarus Lucifer Void.png|50px]] Satan Tartarus Lucifer Void. As mentioned earlier, STLV is a conglomeration of 4 sections, from the name. Here's what each one does and their specialty

*'''''Satan: Your Enemy''''' - Satan, the brains behind the operation. The obstacles, designing and theming all come from this guy. Any obstacles in this difficulty are created by this person. You would think there's a boss fight for this demon. But no, if there was, it would be way too difficult for this obby.
*'''''Tartarus: Your Destiny''''' - This is how, and where you die. Your death, the space between life and death. Purgatory. This continues the torture already given to you. This is probably the most useless of the 4, it just kind of messes with your emotions. Makes you anrgy, depressed, hopless etc.
*'''''Lucifer: Your Torture''''' - The actual obby itself is this. Lucifer is the engineer between the 4. The struggles, time, pain and torture most importantly, it all comes from him. He sends you to the darkest realms of the Inferno.
*'''''Void: Your Hell''''' - This is the space each tower or obby occupies. It is the space of their realms. It is the space of your torture. It is where your enemy resides, and also where you die. This is your hell. Anything in here they control so be wary of around you.

Together, when put in place, make this diabolical difficulty. The obstacles, the journey, the tower and the space. Its a formidable team, you can only pray to the depths of hell for mercy. The heavens won't hear your cries. You're already in too deep.

==Trivia==
*Satan Tartarus Lucifer Void could have been made/concepted as early as September 20th 2020.
*STLV has been revamped many times since revival.
*This difficulty has been previously known to be edgy. Name rechanges have been suggested numerous times but none were seriously taken into consideration.
*Somehow, this difficulty used to have the rating of 66.66 before The Difficulty Extermination.
*This difficulty's rating is 84. That's ''66''+18. 18 is 3x6, or 3 6s. 3 6s can be interpreted as 666. Coincidence? Yea, it's just a fun fact lol.

==Continuing==
You have just beaten the entirety of Mid-Class 11, great job! [[QR Code]] awaits you in High-class 8. Here's a little advice from Satan: Scan the QR code for something good to happen.

But don't take this victory lightly. Satan built this difficulty to be easier just for you. You were meant to beat it. Not because he believes in you. Its because you're already digging your own hell. Satan just wanted a part of it. Happy tortures, my friend, happy tortures. May you plead to the heavens for mercy for your own actions. What a pitiful shame..
