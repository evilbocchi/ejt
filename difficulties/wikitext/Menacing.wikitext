==Description==
<span id="menacing">'''Menacing'''</span> is a [[:Category:Class 2|Class 2]] difficulty directly between the Eternal Towers of Hell difficulties, {{Class2Difficulties|Difficult|25px}} [[w:c:jtoh:Difficult|Difficult]] and {{Class2Difficulties|Challenging|25px}} [[w:c:jtoh:Challenging|Challenging]].<ref>Alternatively between [[File:Strenuous.png|25px]] [[Strenuous]] and [[File:Harming.svg|25px]] [[Harming]] if counting sub-difficulties.</ref> This difficulty is where things start to get properly complicated, as 1 studs are now fairly common-place, and more long jumps start becoming prevalent (7-8 studs), and wraparounds of 5-7 studs can generally be found in this difficulty. Additionally, sometimes glitches may be used. 

A [[Metris|Metris (Kol Metris)]] ranking for this difficulty would rank at about ~|55|, whereas a Tier rating would approximate at about [[Tiers#Tier 7|Tier 7]]. Overall, this difficulty is still fairly easy to beat with patience and some skill.

==Trivia== 
===General===
*This was [[User:Viranenthusiast|vira]]’s second-ever Class 2 difficulty in 2022, only after [[File:Jolliness New New.png|25px]] [[User blog:EpicTheGamer2014/Onerous|Onerous]].
**This was also the second Class 2 difficulty after it was unlocked in 2022 due to {{Class2Difficulties|Insane|25px}} [[w:c:jtoh:Insane|Insane]] and {{Class2Difficulties|Extreme|25px}} [[w:c:jtoh:Extreme|Extreme]] (and by extension, its sub-difficulties) being moved to Class 3.<ref>However, both of these metrics are outdated due to the difficulty chart being shifted multiple times.</ref>
===History===
*This was initially created on the 15th June 2022, called Agitation, and was a main difficulty between {{Class2Difficulties|Difficult|25px}} [[w:c:jtoh:Difficult|Difficult]] (as well as the now deleted [[File:Rage revamp icon.png|25px]] <span id="rage">'''Rage'''</span>) and {{Class2Difficulties|Challenging|25px}} [[w:c:jtoh:Challenging|Challenging]]. 
*On the 20th July 2022, the user [[User:YataDev|YataDev]]<ref>Administrator at the time.</ref> had deleted the difficulty as it was seen as bad. 
*A few hours later, the creator [[User:Viranenthusiast|vira]] revived it in a blog post. At the time, this had given it the technically revived status.
*On the 27th July 2022, it was moved back into the mainspace once again.
*At an unknown date, it was made into a {{Class2Difficulties|Difficult|25px}} [[w:c:jtoh:Difficult|Difficult]] sub-difficulty.
*On the 5th March 2024, it was moved into a blog post once again and turned into a CDC exclusive difficulty due to its lack of towers and overall lack of necessity.
*On the 7th April 2025, just over eleven months later, it was remade into a main difficulty once again and changed to be called <span id="menacing">'''Menacing'''</span>, with a new icon to serve.<ref>The name was changed to make it fit more with the EToH difficulties, just like the icon change.</ref>
*On the 12th August 2025, [[User:Sanjay2133|Sanjay2133]] revived the difficulty, bringing it back to the main difficulty chart.

==Continuing on from this point==
From this point on, there are a variety of choices. Either the player could move onto [[File:Harming.svg|25px]] [[Harming]], <span id="menacing">'''Menacing's'''</span> sole sub-difficulty, or they could simply go to {{Class2Difficulties|Challenging|25px}} [[w:c:jtoh:Challenging|Challenging]].
