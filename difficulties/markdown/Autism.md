# Autism

Autism is a peak class 4 sub-difficulty of Malicious, placed in between Malicious and Malevolent.

This difficulty is named after a condition named Autism, and this sparked tons of controversy, mainly because of the name. Some people found the name of this difficulty to be offensive. This led to many things happening:

- People began vandalizing this page.
- Tons of arguments in the comments talked about how this difficulty’s name was offensive
- Many more things happened, but they were lost to time as this difficulty had so much controversy back in the day

The page eventually got deleted, and then someone re-created the page and changed the name from “Autism” to “Shit”, which caused even more people to get offended, with people even claiming that this wiki hates autistic people. Soon, this page got recreated with the name “Autism”, and to this day, not many people (if anyone) get offended by this difficulty.

This difficulty appeared in many towers, such as Obelisk of Impossible Difficulty Chart. (You could access this floor if you failed Malicious, which was floor 28.) This difficulty would have a tier rating of around ~35-36 and a Kol Metris rating of around 425. An average tower in this difficulty would feature tons of glitches, such as walking on kill bricks, as well as many purist sections, RNG sections, and jump abuse. The difficulty after this is Malevolent (official chart), which is the last TAS possible difficulty (at least by normal means). If anyone were to try this difficulty, they should use blessed coils, vertical mobility, and god mode (or just use the killbrick immunity tab glitch).

Most towers in this difficulty have tons of instakills, which will most likely respawn people who attempt towers with this difficulty on sight. Towers in this difficulty, and any class 4 difficulty for that matter, will have parts where you will lose tons of progress.
