# Rewardable

Rewardable is a Low Class 2 sub-difficulty that sits between Intermediate and Hard. It is known for its friendly nature and unique shop system: every obstacle you attempt or complete earns you points, which can be spent on temporary abilities to help you progress. However, these abilities are lost upon death and must be re-earned. Rewardable is designed to encourage problem-solving and quick trials, making it an approachable and supportive step in the difficulty chart.
