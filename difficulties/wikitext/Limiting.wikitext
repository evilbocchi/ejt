Welcome to the 20th last Class 8 difficulty! Before you reassure yourself, another demanding obstacle lies ahead for you to face, Limiting, The Realm of Theoretical Impossibility comes after this. where everything becomes absolutely absurd. This will be quite the enjoyable ride, won’t it? This difficulty comes before [[File:Screenshot 2020-09-26 032504.jpg|frameless|30x30px]] [[The Crystal Core]] and after [[File:BobuxDeath.png|frameless|30x30px]] [[BobuxDeath]].

This difficulty is really hard to complete, as comparing this to the aforementioned [[File:BobuxDeath.png|frameless|30x30px]] [[BobuxDeath]] is like comparing something as hard as [[User blog:EpicTheGamer2014/Decimation|Decimation]] to an easy difficulty such as [[User blog:EpicTheGamer2014/Onerous|Onerous]]. I hope you’re prepared, as this difficulty will be your penultimate challenge to test if you are ready for the next class, Class 13.

However, this isnt theoretically impossible yet, so you can use insanely advanced techniques to pass this, however it would be significantly rng if you weren’t experienced in physical impossible gameplay, so it is recommended to atleast be able to beat [[File:BobuxDeath.png|frameless|30x30px]] [[BobuxDeath]] in a few days, so that you will be able to consistently do the obstacles of this difficulty so that you can easily beat this difficulty.

Now, the last part of this introduction will be to discuss about this difficulty, so the tier is about 500 Oc, and the Kol Metris of this is about |1800|.
==<span style="background:linear-gradient(90deg, blue, grey, black, grey, blue); -webkit-background-clip:text !important; -webkit-text-fill-color:transparent;"><span style="text-shadow: 0 0 25px blue; color: blue;">Icon Representation==
Limiting has an icon with black exterior and a grey octagon in the middle. The black symbols resemble the icons on [[Oblivion]] 4 classes before, [[Asthenic]] as the previous difficulty, [[User blog:EpicTheGamer2014/☼|☼]] as the (former) difficulty after, and [[THE BORDERLINE]] after 4 classes. Finally it has a >:D in the middle.

== <span style="background:linear-gradient(90deg, blue, grey, black, grey, blue); -webkit-background-clip:text !important; -webkit-text-fill-color:transparent;"><span style="text-shadow: 0 0 25px blue; color: blue;">Catches ==
Come on, every modern difficulty has catches!
*You have 8 walk speed.
*You don’t have a gaming chair.
*You have 25 jump power
*Your internet cuts off every 1 minute.
*The winpad constantly disappears every 10 seconds.
*Alright ready? Lets start.

[[File:Asthenic.png|30x30px]]
Beat [[Asthenic]] 3 times.

To the complicated ones now. 

First. Go to roblox studio and build a class 24 tower. After that, fling yourself into a ball and glitch inside while doing a handstand and fling control into the floating point. You have to be pixel perfect and not move a single pixel from your original location except going up. Then, land on a .1 stud block.(come on i know but im not gonna fill this with 0!!) Then do ToVH 10 times on your smart fridge. If all the completions are not the same length restart. Then find a way to get 0 fps and use it to make a 29,750 stud wrap. Done? Good.

Take one drop of water. Measure the number of quarks inside. Yes, quarks, not atoms. Then beat Class 10 that many times. After that, commit a crime in front of the police and get away with it. Go back to roblox and buy 10B robux by investing in bit coin. Do a 30,000 stud unclimbable jump. Then do a 16,500 stud wrap while being tortured and without arms or a body and with catches. Do another fling control onto a stud past the floating point and land on a 0 stud platform. (you have to magically summon one).

Nice job! You passed the Bottom Spectrum. Procceding to Low Spectrum.
|-|Low=
===<span style="text-shadow: 0 0 5px red; color: salmon;">Low Limiting</span>===
Welcome to the low spectrum of the difficulty, This is where stuff stars to venture further into theoretical impossibility.

*31,500 stud wrap
*16,000 stud stick out
*33,000 stud jump
*32,500 stud unclimbable jump
*33,500 stud truss jump
*2.763Qd stud wall hop
*14,750 stud wall hop wrap
*31,250 stud wall hop gap
*1.343Qd stud wall walk
*Beat Baseline Limiting in 1 hour or do it 4 times.
[[File:Asthenic.png|frameless|30x30px]]
[[Asthenic]] 10 times under 1 day.

Again the complicated ones.

Get 100% on your tests while having 0IQ. Get back home and start your computer. Oops. It blew up and you have to fix it with no experience about tech. After rebooting the computer boot up roblox and beat every game within 143.1 minutes, then fling yourself 300.π studs rounded to the 1Qnth decimal. You have to be exact through your whole fling. Then use your good fling control go through instant ban ip bricks. Then find a way to fly without hacks. Beat ToVH 1UnVt times. If all that takes longer than 1UnDe milliseconds then you get sent back to [[The Crystal Core]] and beat it with catches. Lastly, do a backwards long jump in real life and clip though a door then you're done.

Wow. I underestimated you. Good job with the second spectrum in this difficulty. Shall we move on to Low-Mid? Great!

[[File:The Sun Itself.png|frameless|30x30px]]
Beat nerfed [[User blog:EpicTheGamer2014/☼|☼]].

You get the idea alright?

Beat Class 8 except this difficulty as fast as you can, count the seconds then beat class 7 that many times. Die in real life (don't worry if you fail you revive) and heal your injuries in about .1283 seconds. Decipher every ARG within 2.1 hours and BLJ across the globe, Noclip into the backrooms and finish every level in .1 seconds. '''Have fun doing this 5 times on a row.''' Now beat all osu! maps in 1 second while keeping your hand dry. Make sure that Roblox doesn’t false ban anyone again and you’re done.

Let me introduce a term.

UNI2 is a term that is the current size of our observable universe times to the power of 2. This will likely be used for easier stuff.

Ok, now the second one. Wait a UNI2 amount of seconds without getting bored or dying. You have to maintain the active player count of JToH while doing this, after that make a way so that JToH becomes more popular than ToH without convincing anyone. You can’t ban the game by the way. If JToH has less bytes than UNI2 do asthenic 25 times. Beat Class -1 10NoMcUnNgOtMiCe times without touching your computer. If you disconnect, put yourself on a firework and go to space. Somehow not die without a spacesuit and walk the whole circumference of the moon without breaks.

Hey, you beat Low-Mid Limiting! You could take a chill here if you wanted to but I’m not your mom, You could rest or continue to Mid Limiting which is well, harder.

|-|Mid=

Fling into a wall walk and keep wall walking. Do [[Asthenic]] while wall walking and with catches. Get exactly 4.2834828828 on a test with 2 questions. Fly in real life across the solar system without burning or freezing to death. Buy SpaceX, Tesla and Amazon with 1 penny and find a way to fix every problem in the world at once. If a problem arises from your fixing you unfortunately have to do a Class 13 obstacle in 24 days worth of playtime. Find everything in every Find the ___ in 0.01 seconds. If you have enough badges to surpass number one on the leaderboards then do a 36,750 stud jump with a 1 stud wrap around in between. Do the entirety of the difficulty up to this point and you are finished!

Find every human and write their details. Sort their birthdays using bubble sort. This has to be done in a day without any breaks.  Beat the whole difficulty chart until here in a row and if you fail do a random class 14 obstacle. Do [[The Crystal Core]] how many attempts you did divided by 100. Watch every movie within the time it takes to normally watch BFDI 11 : Lofty. If you do that, apply the catches on yourself and put 3,000 TNT in a house. Stand next to it and survive the blast. Lastly, Beat [[Asthenic]] for the last time in under 20 seconds while in the air with your laptop. Finally, you have surpassed the middle of '''Limiting.'''

Do I really need to explain anymore?

Create a legendary page with 1 byte without anyone liking it. If it gets demoted you lose. Do a 345 stud jump and count how many times you succeed within 500 attempts. If its 1, 1e-100% for you to move on. Win every lottery at exactly the same time. No excess, exactly the same time. Hack every account on roblox and log on all of them on one tab and in one nanosecond. Return the accounts to their owners by guessing with no mistakes. Good job, but that was only 1 of 2 complicated ones.

<sup><sub><sup><sub>Tell AlsoGenshin to make BobuxDeath somewhere else because class 12 is already so screwed up</sub></sup></sub></sup>

Ok so actually here it is, Install every virus on the internet without your pc going wrong. If you beat an Instant Win box while doing this you lose. You also have to enter the portal and cant move, leave, disconnect or anything obvious. You have to physically use your skills to escape without winning. Now, do Asthenic 72.1 times, You can fail, however if you do Asthenic will be buffed to Low-Mid Limiting. and so on and on. Revive every difficulty deleted until June 14, 2022 and put them in their original place. If YourNuglyGuy does not approve of this you lose, Lastly, do a 335 stud jump twice in a row

Alrighty, I think you know already, Good job and just go to High Limiting.

ok im not explaining this.

You know PTTT, AToS, GNZT, and others right? Beat all the fangames with difficulty charts ranging from [[ERASE]] to [[Asthenic]].  You have to beat atleast 193,291 towers. Even if there are not that many, you still have to because well, I said so. Do a 375 stud jump with a safety net however, you are only given 10,000 tries to do the jump, if you fail well, I’m afraid I will have to send you back to Mid-High Limiting. Revive every graved difficulty simultaneously without ANY getitng deleted. I am serious about this. Commit every single felony possible on earth without having any sort of punishment about this. Congratulations, I’ts not even a joke at this point

Alright. Go back to intense. Now beat the difficulties in this order.

Oh my god I am so sorry for putting you through that lets return back to Limiting.

Now beat class -1 UNI2 to the UNI2 times. This may look hard however, [[Instant Win]] and [[Skip]] make this really hard to do. Repeat the first 2 complicated obstacles in this difficulty 20 times. You can do this for as long as you want, but if you fail it gets buffed one sub difficulty. This is like Low, to Low-Mid. Now, Beat a tenth of the sun. Just a tenth. You can do this for as long as possible to finish however there is no penalty for failing this time. Now, Beat ToVH 1Qn normally and 40 times on the smart fridge. Huh, reference???????? ok to skyline you go.

|-|Skyline=

*Beat High Limiting in 1 hour or beat ot 3 times.

…

Beat [[Obelisk of Endless Difficulty Amplifying]] secret ending and [[Obelisk of Impossible Difficulty Chart]] buffed by 2, and 4, classes respectively. Fail Exist while existing and tell [[Universal Destruction]] to actually shut up so that we dont have our 1 byte of ram combust into flames and burn your house down. Now do a 1T stud wallwalk with 0.0001 velocity spinners spinning around you with around 192,398,399 of them chasing you at once while flying in real life and running away from your computer after insulting 100 simps and your internet router blowing up so that you physically cannot play anymore and nuke Russia. 

Just move on to the final obstacle of this difficulty.

Oh god, I procrastinated for so long. Here it is,

First, find a way to activate gogo oodle rocket boots in real life and manage to control them. This is kind of hard but I’m sure you can do it! Solve 3x+1 and every math question in the world at once with 1 IQ, I mean, I am going to return it if you fail or succeed so no worries I guess. Now, this will possibly be the most painful objective by far right now. This will be… Beat every obstacle in Limiting in a row, You have infinite tries but no boosts and no penalty for failing except having to retry doing this obstacle again. Now, beat Dark Markery but he has 10^UNI2^UNI2 health.

Huh.
