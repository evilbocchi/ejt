# Shattered Babass

This difficulty belongs to LIA's Babass Family. Shattered Babass is a Class 0 Difficulty coming before Automatic but after Unlosable, Roll, or Mazeophobia. It is the second last automatic difficulty behind Automatic. Shattered Babass is basically too easy, so just skip to Class 1 or even Class 2, but if you actually struggle, stay here for now. There is no reason to be on this sub-difficulty unless you are in a DCT.
