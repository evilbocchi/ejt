==Lore==
At this point you feel accomplished on what you've done so far. Getting past [[File:BRYANJR4474 DIFFICULTY.jpeg|30px]] [[Bryanjr4474]]. But at the end you get thrown into a void-like pathway. You take a few steps and a sign with orange text comes out of nowhere. It reads "Let's go back to a previous point. Have a little fun maybe?" You have no choice but to click the sign. You loose control of your avatar and camera and your camera zooms out. Eventually moving to the [[File:Ʀhotic.png|frameless|30x30px]] [[Ʀhotic|<span style="background:linear-gradient(lime,cyan,orange,pink); -webkit-background-clip:text !important; -webkit-text-fill-color:transparent;">'''ʀhotic'''</span>]] floor. A bit later some red text appears on the top of the screen reading "Let's play a game." After you finish reading the screen tilts red. Your camera moves up to the [[File:BRYANJR4474 DIFFICULTY.jpeg|30px]] [[Bryanjr4474]] floor then goes left. You eventually see a dark red floor appear where the camera is. The camera goes back to your character. Your character is transported to the unknown floor and then you can control it again. You read the floor sign. It says one word. "Eɼɼosion".

==What is this?==
{{NewDifficultyInfobox|title1=[[File:Imageforsomething....png|frameless|30x30px]] <span style="background:linear-gradient(#452100,#450000); -webkit-background-clip:text !important; -webkit-text-fill-color:transparent;">'''Eɼɼosion'''</span> |image1=Imageforsomething....png|caption1=Based on what the sign near the end of the [[Bryanjr4474]] floor said.

So you wonder what [[File:Imageforsomething....png|frameless|30x30px]] <span style="background:linear-gradient(#452100,#450000); -webkit-background-clip:text !important; -webkit-text-fill-color:transparent;">'''Eɼɼosion'''</span> is? You should check the infobox. If you are dumb and cant check it [[File:Imageforsomething....png|frameless|30x30px]] <span style="background:linear-gradient(#452100,#450000); -webkit-background-clip:text !important; -webkit-text-fill-color:transparent;">'''Eɼɼosion'''</span> is a peak class 9 buffed difficulty between [[File:BRYANJR4474 DIFFICULTY.jpeg|30px]] [[Bryanjr4474]]<nowiki/>and [[File:Dynamix.png|frameless|30x30px]] [[Dynamix]].

== Icon representation ==
The icon depicts a very dark gradient of red to orange. There is also a blatantly obvious ɻ.ɻ emoticon in the center. You should have a familiarity with this. As it is similar to that of [[File:Ʀhotic.png|frameless|30x30px]] <span style="background:linear-gradient(lime,cyan,orange,pink); -webkit-background-clip:text !important; -webkit-text-fill-color:transparent;">'''''ʀhotic'''''</span>. After all. This is buffed [[File:Ʀhotic.png|frameless|30x30px]] <span style="background:linear-gradient(lime,cyan,orange,pink); -webkit-background-clip:text !important; -webkit-text-fill-color:transparent;">'''''ʀhotic'''''</span>.

== Catches ==
Haven't seen any since fallen. Well, why not bring them back.

* You have 1,4914821041238 jump-power while you need to do Tower of Anger every 1.25 seconds with a KB spinner that spins every 0.032 seconds
* You have 0.75 walk speed, and you are in 2 earthquakes happening at the same time.
* You must destroy the earth twice.
* Every brick does 7 damage every 0.125 seconds but can become an instant kill anytime
* Jumping flips gravity
* You are walking backwards
* The win-pad deletes itself after 9 tenths of a minute.
* Walkspeed is changed to a random integer ranging from 1 to 10^10000 every 10 seconds, also jumping from the start to the winpad causes your skill to go back to [[The First Difficulty|The Start]].
== Obstacles ==
=== Erroded ===
==== Part 1 - Radiation of The Core ====
* Do a 1060 stud cylindrical wrap, while touching the radiation of 1508e+17.MM
* Beat [[File:NEaT resized.png|frameless|30x30px]] [[Neat]] into the negatives in 40^10 (10485760000000000) seconds. If a difficulty is into the negatives you win in negative seconds. Negative seconds isn't possible to wait so it's impossible.
* Do a 1500010E+86 stud wrap with 1E155 jump power and 18 speed. (NERFED)
* Beat [[File:NewNullifying.jpeg|frameless|30x30px]] [[Nullifying]] but it got rebirthed except you have to do it twice. (NERFED EVEN MORE)
* There are 6.53720E+15 (6537202910373671529) buttons in your view. You must press one of them. If you press the actual button, you move on to the next obstacle. But if you don't you automatically get yeeted into a buffed version of Yeetbox. Do it 452VT^452VG in 40 seconds. The core on the previous floor might radiate extra time and it radiates here. (NERFED)
* Beat UPA (whatever it is) in a zone twice. Do that while beating ring 1 in 15 seconds, but you have to beat it 451K^456KE+110VG times. (NERFED)
* Do a math equation adding up every single number from the previous difficulties which we will represent that number as Ͳ. Get the exact value of Ͳ in half a second. Then do a Ͳ^(TRLGx1.5) stud wrap.
* A two stud walkaround. Seems easy untill you have to do it 1UVG^1UVG times. (NERFED)
* Do a 1e+12DVG stud walkaround but you have 1 speed. (NERFED)
* You've made critikal disappointed due to doing these obstacles for so long. Make him not disappointed. However, after you make him not disappointed a red vase breaks so he gets disappointed again. So, you have to make him not disappointed twice.
==== Part 2 - Falling from Absurd Heights ====
* Do a 10^4339 stud wrap with an instant-kb will hop every 10^78 studs while a kb spinner is activated every 7 and a half seconds, This is followed by an obstacle which you need 10^50 IQ to pass. (NERFED)
* Beat Tower of Impossible Expectations 4 times in 3-̸-4 (3 quarters) of a minute. There are also 2 huge instant-kb spinners. If you die you must start from the beginning.
* Beat [[File:EasyDifficulty.jpg|frameless|30x30px]] [[w:c:jtoh:Easy|<span style="color:#00FF00">Easy</span>]] except you can't move or jump and it is Rebirth'd.
* Do a 11 stud wrap with a 10^41 stud ban-brick stick-out in the wrap. There is also a catch. Every quarter of a second you randomly move. You will need to fling yourself into the backrooms. Escape the backrooms and spawn on the other side of the wrap. But the win-pad has a 99.999999999% chance to kick you if you touch it. (NERFED)
* Walk a 250 stud long tightrope that is 0.00000625 studs thick. There is some 10^73 stud stick-outs on it that spawn randomly. You must do it in 1 second while being chased by 2 copies of the goose from [[File:Xi-Alpha revamp icon.png|frameless|30x30px]] [[Xi-Alpha]]. The geese are moving at 40 studs per second. (NERFED)
* Get a TAS that can make you move faster so you could escape from a black hole. There is also a meteor coming at you at 10^59 per second. If you touch the meteor, you will get banned from the game. You also must beat Tower of Augmented Misery every 8 seconds with no way to exploit, hack, or cheat. However, the catches aren't there so you have a slightly higher chance of beating the obstacle. (NERFED)
== Towers with this difficulty ==

=== Non-Fictional ===

* No. There is going to be absolutely no real towers with this difficulty. Buildability ended at class 13. This is beyond that. So, no. There is not going to be a non-Fictional tower of this difficulty.

=== Fictional ===

* Maths Tower of Pure Rhoticity (MToPR)
* Box of Absolute R-Coloring (BoAR)

=== Difficulty Chart Towers ===

* Add

== Trivia ==

* This originally was going to be called Coloʁ as a reference to R-Color vowels. It was changed to the current name [[File:Imageforsomething....png|frameless|30x30px]] <span style="background:linear-gradient(#452100,#450000); -webkit-background-clip:text !important; -webkit-text-fill-color:transparent;">'''Eɼɼosion'''</span> due to the previous name not sounding like a Class 14 (Class 9.
* A teaser for this was made. A post for it can be found [https://jtohs-joke-towers.fandom.com/f/p/4400000000000109968 here].
* The emoticon ɻ.ɻ is made using the Voiced Retroflex Approximant. Just like how the emoticon of [[File:Ʀhotic.png|frameless|30x30px]] [[Ʀhotic|<span style="background:linear-gradient(lime,cyan,orange,pink); -webkit-background-clip:text !important; -webkit-text-fill-color:transparent;">'''ʀhotic'''</span>]] or ʁ_ʁ is made using the Voiced Uvular Fricative.
* The icon was made only in Scratch unlike [[File:Ʀhotic.png|frameless|30x30px]] [[Ʀhotic|<span style="background:linear-gradient(lime,cyan,orange,pink); -webkit-background-clip:text !important; -webkit-text-fill-color:transparent;">'''ʀhotic'''</span>]] which was made in Pixlr X and Scratch.
* Some of the obstacles were nerfed to stuff from Vigintillion to Octovigintillion. This is due to some numbers being way too big for c14. Sanjay was the one that pointed this out and caused it to be changed.
