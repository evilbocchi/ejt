# Death Chain

The Death Chain is a sequence of difficulties that all follow MegaDeath. Each Death Chain difficulty is related by name, icon, or theme, and they are known for being extremely challengingâ€”most are in Class 8, with two reaching Class 9. Completing all Death Chain difficulties is a monumental task. Notably, PentaDeath and MegaDeath are among the most popular and well-known entries in the chain, with MegaDeath being especially legendary.
