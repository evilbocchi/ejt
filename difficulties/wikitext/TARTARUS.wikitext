==What is <span style="color:#c2dff1">'''TARTARUS'''</span>?==
<span style="color:#c2dff1">'''TARTARUS'''</span> is a difficulty assigned to towers harder than [[HELL|<span style="color:#7ab6e9">'''HELL'''</span>]] but easier than [[Unimaginable|<span style="color:#f00">'''Unimaginable'''</span>]]. It is represented with a very light blue with an XD on it. <span style="color:#c2dff1">'''TARTARUS'''</span> difficulty towers truly bend the limits of conceptual Roblox physics, which is superficially impossible to understand obstacles of <span style="color:#c2dff1">'''TARTARUS'''</span> difficulty as they are extremely esoteric. Using TAS, this difficulty is still very much impossible, as it is filled with frame-perfect, pixel-perfect, and RNG inputs for most of the constituent parts whilst needing nigh perfect understanding of physics, which in itself is already an impressive breakthrough feat.
