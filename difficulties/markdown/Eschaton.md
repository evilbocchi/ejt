# Eschaton

Eschaton is a joke difficulty initially added during an Event Realm event, then later used as a difficulty in the April Fools 2025 event. Currently, there are only two towers in-game assigned to this difficulty: Tower of Eve Is Ent and Huvin ja Hauskanpidon Torni. Although it is placed above Unreal on the difficulty chart, Eschaton is not considered Soul Crushing.
