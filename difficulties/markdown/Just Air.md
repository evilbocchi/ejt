# Just Air

Just Air is a Class 0 difficulty represented by a sky blue background and a white 'H'. The main challenge is simply falling or being elevated onto a winpad, with no real obstacles. It is one of the easiest difficulties, often completed after Win or Do Nothing.

Obstacles include falling or elevating various distances onto a winpad, or waiting for a short period. Just Air is designed to be unfailable, making it a perfect introduction for new players before moving on to slightly more complex challenges.
