[[File:Eternalized.png|frameless|30x25px]] '''Eternal''' is a class 3 difficulty, located after {{Class3Difficulties|Horrific|25px}} [[w:c:jtohs-hardest-towers:Horrific|Horrific]], and before {{Class3Difficulties|Unreal|25px}} [[w:c:jtohs-hardest-towers:Unreal|Unreal]] or it's sub difficulty, [[File:Confidence.png|link=Confident|30x25px]] [[Confident]]. To put it simply, it is extremely difficult to complete, and <u>''requires extensive knowledge of intricate glitches and mechanics found within Roblox’s obbies and towers.''</u> 

Despite this being humanly possible, and towers of this difficulty being currently feasible for any obbyists (due to every spectrum of this difficulty being possible), it is recommended any player willing to attempt this difficulty utilizes Tool Assisted Speedrun while trying to beat this. This is because it makes the obstacles significantly easier, and they won’t spend hundreds (if not thousands) of hours on towers of this difficulty.

Currently, '''Eternal''' additionally reflects obstacles seen in skyline {{Class3Difficulties|Horrific|25px}} [[w:c:jtohs-hardest-towers:Horrific|Horrific]] and belowground [[File:Confidence.png|link=Confident|30x25px]] [[Confident]], despite being listed as between the two.

==Obstacle Overview ==
Obstacles of this difficulty are not for the faint of heart, as they contain troublesome mechanics and very few breaks. They can also end up being very intricate and hard to predict at times.

==Trivia==
*During development, '''Eternal'''’s icon received a revamp to make it in the style of the current [[w:c:jtohs-hardest-towers:Horrific|Horrific]] and [[w:c:jtohs-hardest-towers:Unreal|Unreal]] icons. It became the old JToH style icon, however that decision was quickly reverted.
*This difficulty was revamped to try and save it from being deleted in an omnicide, albeit the icon was the problem for '''Eternal'''.
*On the 5th August 2022, this difficulty became a sub difficulty of [[w:c:jtohs-hardest-towers:Horrific|Horrific]], as per the Class 1-3 cleanup. However, [[File:Confidence.png|frameless|25x25px]] [[User blog:EpicTheGamer2014/Confident|Confident]] was still between {{Class3Difficulties|Horrific|25px}} [[w:c:jtohs-hardest-towers:Horrific|Horrific]] and {{Class3Difficulties|Unreal|25px}} [[w:c:jtohs-hardest-towers:Unreal|Unreal]].
**Due to this, [[Eternalized]] was swapped with [[File:Confidence.png|frameless|25x25px]] [[User blog:EpicTheGamer2014/Confident|Confident]], and became a non-sub difficulty once again. This occurred on the 1st March 2023 (along with its revamp), almost 7 months after the initial change of placement.
***Some of this information is now outdated as [[File:Confidence.png|link=Confident|30x25px]] [[Confident]] is a sub difficulty of Eternal.
*A second revamp was put into place for this difficulty approximately nine months after the initial revamp date, and nearly ten months after it’s initial creation date, to bring it up to current ''{{SITENAME}}'' standards.
*This is likely [[User:Viranenthusiast|vira]]<nowiki/>’s most detailed and comprehensive article made on this wiki.
*This difficulty was<nowiki/> formerly the world record for the [[The Pyramid Brothers/JJT Pyramid|JJT Pyramid]], set by AgileGamez.
*On 5th August 2024,<nowiki/> this difficulty was renamed to '''Eternal''', due to the fact that Eternalized generally is not a good name for this kind of difficulty
*There was a difficu<nowiki/>lty also named '''Eternal''' in C24, but it got deleted.

==Continuing on from this point ==
After completing '''Eternal''', it is fair to say {{USERNAME}} is likely the most dedicated, motivated and determined obbyist any person has ever seen. After all the struggles, all the hardships, all those hours spent on one singular difficulty. Now, if they wish, they can go on to practice {{Class3Difficulties|Unreal|25px}} [[w:c:jtohs-hardest-towers:Unreal|Unreal]] difficulty towers. {{DifficultiesNavbox}}
