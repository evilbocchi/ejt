# OooOOOoOOOOooo above catastrophic difficulty OoOOooOOoo

OooOOOoOOOOooo above catastrophic difficulty OoOOooOOoo is a joke difficulty added during the April Fools 2021 event, represented by a black square with white text. It was removed after the event but returned in April Fools 2024. This difficulty is likely a parody of fanmade difficulties that are above nil. There is currently one event tower with this difficulty, which is impossible to enter without completing a series of quests.
