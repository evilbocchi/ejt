# Infinity

Infinity is a Class 7, Physically Impossible difficulty found at the beginning of Peak Class 7, near the start of physical impossibility. Originally created by Octogoat YT, it was later revamped by Viranenthusiast and Astrominal. This difficulty features obstacles that are so extreme—such as instakill spinners with 100 speed and jumps requiring inhuman precision—that they cannot be completed by a human or even with Tool-Assisted Speedruns (TAS) unless exploits are used.

Infinity is classified as Physically Impossible, meaning no human or TAS can beat it under normal circumstances. The difficulty introduces spinning insta-kill bricks at mid to high ranges, and offers optional choices to buff or nerf the challenge. With these options, obstacle difficulty ranges from 55 to over 3 million studs, spanning from Hopeless to Vrery hawrfd rdifficutl!!, or Class 7 to Class 9.

As the first and easiest Peak Class 7 difficulty, Infinity surpasses Plum Bloc and precedes Doog, marking its place between these two in the chart. The difficulty is notorious for its impossible obstacles and is only possible to complete by abusing TAS or exploiting.
