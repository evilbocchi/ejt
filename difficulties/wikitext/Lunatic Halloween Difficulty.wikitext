==Introduction==
Lunatic Halloween Difficulty is an unofficial difficulty placed after [[File:Effortful.png|frameless|30x30px]][[Effortful]] and before [[File:Unbounded.jpg|frameless|30x30px]][[Unboundable]]. This difficulty is so hard, if you were to compare [[Effortful]] to this, it would be like comparing [[The First Difficulty]] to [[Effortful]].

== Icon Reprsentation ==

=== Icon 1 ===
[[File:Lunatic Halloween Difficulty.png|100x100px]]

This is a rather complex icon as it contains a starry background with a purple glow in the middle, a moon can be seen in the corner as well, there is also red text saying "LUNATIC HALLOWEEN DIFFICULTY" and a bloody, razor toothed, carved pumpkin in the center.

=== Icon 2 ===
[[File:Pumkin.png|100x100px]]

This icon is more simplistic than icon 1, containing a pumpkin model on top of a baseplate, with the image pixelated, and the colors changed.

== Obstacles ==
* Beat [[File:Effortful.png|frameless|30x30px]][[Effortful]] <math>\aleph_{\omega}</math> times with all of the catches, old and new.
* Trick-or-Treat at <math>\epsilon_{LNGN^{LNGN}}</math> houses and get <math>\zeta_1</math> pieces of candy at Christmas without a costume.
* Somehow get a negative amount of candy.
* Make every costume possible in <math>-\aleph_{Rayo(10^{100})}</math> seconds.
* Get a single piece of candy in a universe where Halloween and candy exists and doesn't exist at the same time.
* Do a MACC in real life, except the wall is made out of candy and you don't exist.
* Survive Joe.
* Beat [[w:c:jtoh:Steeple of Tricks and Treats|Steeple of Tricks and Treats]], while it's buffed to [[File:Effortful.png|frameless|30x30px]][[Effortful]] difficulty and there's <math>\aleph_{\omega}</math> GarBrick spinners at <math>-\aleph_{\omega}</math> velocity.
* Be reincarnated as a pumpkin with <math>-\aleph_{\Sigma_{\Sigma}}</math> and get flung <math>\aleph_{\Sigma}</math> light years out of the universe while you don't exist.
* Become ABSOLUTE NOTHING for Halloween and get <math>Tree(\infin^\infin(Expan))</math>candies within -Gar days from people who cant think
* Survive a cave while they are a variety of spooky creatures like witches, skeletons, and zombies while they move at <math>\aleph_{\omega}</math>c (c means speed of light so they move way faster than the speed of light) while you move at <math>\frac{1}{\aleph_{\omega}}</math>c
* Somehow convince aliens from (TREE(SCG(EXPAN))) light eons away to give you candy without doing anything.
* eat a pickled cream cheese and green ham beaner sandwich with a greaseful of olive oil in 0.000001 planck seconds
* Trick death every single second until the heat death of the universe
*Eat <math>\aleph_{\omega}</math> gigatons of candy corn, while they're all poisonous. Also, for every piece of candy corn you eat, you must do a random obstacle from [[File:Effortful.png|frameless|30x30px]][[Effortful]].
*Change the timeline so that pomegranates replace pumpkins in halloween, but pomegranates, time, and halloween dont exist.
*Dress as a scone for halloween and get TREE(TREE(TREE(TREE.....infinite TREES and 3s later...3)3)3)3)3) baguettes and only baguettes and only from frogs, or else you spontaneously combust.

==Catches==

* You have to build everything out of candy.
* You don't exist.
* Every candy obstacle you build is unanchored.
* There is no winpad in this difficulty.
* Your unlucky self has to do this in a cave.
* You're fighting every user in reality.
* You must run from slush. Hide.
* You can't.
* You must eat a scythe, make sure that is digested the planck time you lick it.
* You are <span style="color:yellow">NOW <s>YELLOW</s></span> an oganesson atom. Try to do all of the obstacles before you <span style="color:yellow">DECAY!</span> ⛈️⛈️⛈️
* You have to do this while trick or treating in real life with a phone that runs the game at negative 1 million FPS
* You need to eat <math>\aleph_{Rayo(10^{100})}</math>candies every planck second
* The only way to win is by doing this in Halloween, except the day is zero seconds long
* After you’re done, you must eat all of the candies you got in approximately -ω seconds. '''Easy, right?'''

==Continuing from this Point==
'''HOW? LITERALLY HOW?''' That doesn't matter. What matters is that you beat this difficulty. [[File:Unbounded.jpg|frameless|30x30px]][[Unboundable]] is next, so that’s awesome!
