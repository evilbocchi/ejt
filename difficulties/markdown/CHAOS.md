# CHAOS

CHAOS is a Humanly Impossible High Class 4 Sub-Difficulty, coming after SUFFER and before Aleph-Null. It is a challenge even for the best Tool Assisted Speedrunners (TAS), with obstacles and gameplay designed to create absolute chaos. CHAOS is known for its high difficulty rating and is not recommended for most players due to its extreme challenge.
