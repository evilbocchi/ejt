# Intense

Intense is a difficulty in EToH represented by a black hexagon. It sits between Challenging and Remorseless, and is often considered the gateway to higher difficulties. Obstacles are harder than those in Challenging towers but not as tough as Remorseless. Typical challenges include 7–9 stud wraparounds and 10–11 stud long jumps, with a significant risk of falling.

Intense is the most common difficulty in-game, with many towers, steeples, and citadels assigned to it. It marks a considerable increase in challenge and is a key milestone for players progressing through the difficulty chart.
