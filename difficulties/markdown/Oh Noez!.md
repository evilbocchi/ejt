# Oh Noez!

Oh Noez! is a Class 10 joke difficulty themed around computer viruses and popups. After beating Zany, players are humorously "infected" with a virtual virus, facing impossible obstacles and a barrage of distractions. The difficulty is intentionally absurd and physically impossible, serving as a playful and comedic entry in the chart.
