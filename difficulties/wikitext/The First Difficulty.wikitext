==Overview==
'''The First Difficulty''' is the ''absolute beginning'' of your journey and the easiest of all difficulties. This difficulty is even below bottom [[File:TheLowerGapRemake.png|50x50px]] [[The Lower Gap]] and anything in between.  

This difficulty is the exact opposite of [[File:Final.png|50x50px]] [[The Final Difficulty.|The Final Difficulty]] (TFD). Instead of being infinitely unbeatable, it is infinitely unlosable, no matter what kind of logic is applied.  

Unlike [[File:Negativity.png|30x30px]] [[Negativity]] (where you need a negative existence rank to lose), there is no exception to winning. Even if you don't exist, you are less than any form of existence, you are beyond any form of existence, you have control over your existence on any sort of space/time plane imaginable, you have infinite power, or even you have a;; these things and more at the same time, you will still always unwillingly win this difficulty.  

This difficulty is impossible to build, even with unlimited scripting capabilities beyond that of existence. Even if you had the powers of a god and spent all of your immortality into losing this difficulty, you would still win.

== Obstacles==
There are no obstacles, there are no towers, there are no winpads or winrooms, there isn't even a difficulty or an omniverse containing this difficulty, just a concept that everything and nothing are simultaneously and always winning, the embodiment of unwilling success.

Even if you somehow lose, you still win. Even if you find a loophole around this, the difficulty will rewrite time to fix this loophole. And if you try to stop the difficulty from rewriting time, it will rewrite time so you never did.

Losing this difficulty is as hard as beating [[File:Final.png|50x50px]] [[The Final Difficulty.|The Final Difficulty]], and beating [[File:Final.png|50x50px]] [[The Final Difficulty.|The Final Difficulty]] is as hard as losing this difficulty. This will never change and will always be true, even if every verse and dimension ceased to exist.

You just can't lose. Nothing needs to exist to win, not even a universe, or an infinitiverse.

== Towers==
This is the easiest difficulty in JJT, so nothing is accurate. But here you go, I guess.

*[[The First Tower]] (TFT) (Fictional)
*[[The Light of the Universe]] (TLotU)
*[[Tower of Universal Euphoria]] (ToUE) (TFU:R01)
*[[Tower of The Easiest Completion]] (ToTEC)

==Trivia==

*This difficulty uses everything that TFD uses to bypass difficulties that claim to be "the First Difficulty", e.g. defying logic.
* You could say this is the opposite of [[File:Final.png|50x50px]] [[The Final Difficulty.|The Final Difficulty]].

==How to beat the difficulty==
It seems like you already beat this difficulty instantaneously without any effort. Also, you are already zooming past some difficulties with infinite speed. I can't even explain to you what your next difficulties are. You won’t even have the time to comprehend what is happening on screen. But if you somehow, fail this (you won't), just go ahead and do a TFD tower.  

==Continuing from this point==
I think you already have experienced some obbies before you entered this wiki, but I don't recommend you to do this difficulty before starting your obby journey. Please, skip these simplistic difficulties and start doing [[File:Effortless difficulty.png|30x30px]] [[w:c:jtoh:Effortless|Effortless]] difficulty obbies. You don't even need to see what comes after this difficulty, but if you are curious, head to [[File:TheLowerGapRemake.png|50x50px]] [[The Lower Gap]].
