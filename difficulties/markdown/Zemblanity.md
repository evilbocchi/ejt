Zemblanity is an unclassified difficulty that serves as a generalized placement for Tower of Bizarre Blitz but its scope could be expanded to encompass additional structures in the future. As is the case with other unclassified difficulties, there are no clear before or upper after, but the current lower bound is Madness, and the upper known limit is Transfinite. But it is possible that in The Questionable Domain Project, the presently unclassified Tower of Bizarre Blitz could attain class 30 status.

In Kol Metris, Zemblanity can range from around 130 to around 650. The minimum and maximum difficulty ratings for Zemblanity are as low as 9.5 but as high as 48. (Note that this only includes known limits.)

The word zemblanity can be defined as "unlucky, or unwanted but predictable events", the word is antonymic to serendipity meaning "unplanned fortunate, discoveries". The origin of the word "zemblanity" likely comes from the island Nova Zembla (more commonly, Novaya Zemlya).
