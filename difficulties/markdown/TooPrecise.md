# TooPrecise

TooPrecise is the final Class 7 sub-difficulty and the only sub-difficulty of MegaDeath. It requires players to conquer obstacles that are, as the name suggests, too precise. Even the smallest mistake can result in failure, and the difficulty is so high that it is nearly impossible to complete.

As a sub-difficulty of MegaDeath, TooPrecise is slightly harder and is known for its unconventional, glitch-based obstacles. It is mostly theoretically possible, but the level of precision required is beyond what most players can achieve.
