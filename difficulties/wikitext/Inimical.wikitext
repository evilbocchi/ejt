[[File:Inimical.PNG|frameless|30x30px]] <span style="color:#FF0000">'''{{PAGENAME}}'''</span> is a Class 5 sub-difficulty. This sub-difficulty is beyond humanly impossible, and never will be humanly possible. Trying any jump in this difficulty is a waste of time. Even if you try your hardest to even complete a jump, you will fail to do so. But don't worry, that's my goal isn't it? 

== Icon Representation==
[[File:Inimical.PNG|frameless|30x30px]] <span style="color:#FF0000">'''{{PAGENAME}}'''</span>'s icon looks similar to a lot of the icons of other Class 5 difficulties. It has a gradient from red to black. Staying true to the other difficulties in this section, it also contains the Greek letter 'Σ', known as 'Sigma' in the middle.

You haven't completed this difficulty in reality, have you? Well. I don't care. Since you "triumphed" over this difficulty, your next goal would to be "completing" [[File:Horrendous.png|30x30px]] [[Horrendous]]. Good luck with that.
