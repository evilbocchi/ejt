'''<span style="background:linear-gradient(330deg, #5602FF, #1C04EB); -webkit-background-clip:text !important; -webkit-text-fill-color:transparent;">Angerable''''s icon is a white emoticon >.<, on the middle of a purple background, similar to the one in {{Class2Difficulties|Relentless}} [[Relentless]].

Old Icon=
[[File:Angerable.png|frameless|35x35px]] 
The previous icon is nearly identical to the current icon, but the emoticon is less thick and the background is more purple.

Alternate Icon=
===[[File:Angerable Alt.png|frameless|35x35px]] Alternate===

The alternate icon for this difficulty is quite similar to what the current one is, but with a few twists. The background is now a gradient, going from blue, to a darker shade of blue. The emoticon is also rotated a tiny bit.
