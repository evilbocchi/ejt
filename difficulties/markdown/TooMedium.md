# TooMedium

TooMedium is a Class 2 difficulty that is harder than Intense but easier than Severe. While it is still humanly possible, most jumps in this difficulty require a good amount of skill and patience. It is recommended to attempt TooMedium after mastering mid-Intense obstacles, as it can be surprisingly challenging for unprepared players.

TooMedium is part of the "Too Chain," a series of difficulties that are buffs of the normal JToH difficulties. It tests skill and patience, serving as a stepping stone to harder challenges.
