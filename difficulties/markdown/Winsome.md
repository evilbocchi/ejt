Winsome is an Unofficial Class 0 difficulty. This specific difficulty lies after Win, yet before Do Nothing. It has a rating of -28, and is the supposed final difficulty in the "Chain of Winning", which isnâ€™t actually an established chain.

Due to its extremely low placement in the Difficulty Chart, Winsome lies near the beginning of human possibility, as the second difficulty of the second class. Anyone, from robloxians with very low IQ, to even possibly some animals (excluding humanity), could quite easily complete such a difficulty as Winsome.

It is literally automated at this point, and incredibly boring. Some may even wonder why this difficulty exists.
