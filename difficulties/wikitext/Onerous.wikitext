[[File:Onerous.png|30px]] <span style="color:#FF492A">'''Onerous'''</span> is a transitional difficulty between the Eternal Towers of Hell difficulties {{Class1Difficulties|Hard|30px}} [[w:c:jtoh:Hard|Hard]] and {{Class1Difficulties|Easeful}} [[Easeful]], it's sub-difficulty. While this difficulty is still on the lower spectrum of the EToH difficulty chart, it is still relatively difficult. Killbricks are a particularly common obstacle, along with more difficult jumps and somewhat complex contraptions now being present. While not particularly common, one stud platforms can be found scattered across the towers categorised under '''Onerous'''. 

More dedication is required, but <span style="color:#FF492A">'''Onerous'''</span> is still a relatively easy difficulty.
==Obstacles==
Keep in mind that due to the variance of obstacle difficulty, these generally should not be used as a basis for obstacles.

==Trivia==
*Initially, <span style="color:#FF492A">'''Onerous'''</span> would have been aimed for the old [[:Category:Class 1|Class 1]] ([[Delightful]] to [[User_blog:EpicTheGamer2014/Easeful|Easeful]]).
**The aim was changed to the old [[:Category:Class 2|Class 2]] ('''Onerous''' to [[Relentless]]) due to the sheer amount of C1 difficulties at the time.
*This is the sequel to [[File:Calmness.png|30px]] [[Calm]].
*This difficulty was deleted twice. 
**The first time was during the obscure '''Difficulty Purge''', before being revived a very short time after.
**The second time<ref>Not technically a deletion.</ref> was being moved to a blog post due to '''The Difficulty Extermination'''.
