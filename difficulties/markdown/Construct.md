# Construct

Construct is an Unclassified difficulty with a unique mechanic: players can place parts in a tower using the "Blueprint" tool and remove them with the "Hammer." Some areas, called "Barriers," restrict part placement, while "Deadly Barriers" reset the run if entered. The difficulty can range from Class Negative to Class 22, depending on adjustments. Construct introduces creative building mechanics, requiring players to strategize part placement and removal to progress. It is a work in progress, with more features and obstacles planned.
