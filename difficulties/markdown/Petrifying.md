# Petrifying

Petrifying is a Class 3 difficulty, considered tougher than Terrifying but easier than Catastrophic, the final canon Juke's Towers of Hell difficulty. It is also regarded as more challenging than Horrifying, but less so than Alarming, its only sub-difficulty. Petrifying is the penultimate canon non-sub difficulty in its range and is equivalent to an old iteration of the Tower of Augmented Misery. This difficulty is known for its challenging obstacles and is a significant step up in difficulty.
