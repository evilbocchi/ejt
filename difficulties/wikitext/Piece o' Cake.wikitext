==What is '''Piece o' Cake'''?==
<span style="text-shadow:#FE95FD">'''Piece o' Cake'''</span> is a sub-difficulty by the creators of [[Great Citadel of Custom, Impossible, and Normal Difficulties]] located in between {{Class0Difficulties|Pleasant}} [[Pleasant]] and [[File:Tutorial.png|30px]] [[Tutorial]]. This is also the first difficulty that requires you to move your camera (but only by a bit), all obstacles here are the exact same garbage, walking, climbing slopes, and maybe climbing ladders. This difficulty is really easy, most noobs can beat this. (Especially when you are smart enough to avoid [[File:New_Eternified_Partyness.png|30x30px]] [[Eternified Partyness]]'s fakeout)

It's the 10th hardest difficulty in Class 1. It's easier than {{Class0Difficulties|Pleasant}} [[Pleasant]] but harder than [[File:Tutorial.png|30px]] [[Tutorial]]. Overall this difficulty is extremely easy, the day you can join Roblox is the day you beat this.

When compared to the current icon, this icon made the emoticon smaller and used a stroke instead of filling the characters. Along with that, its background is more detailed than the other two icons, which are solid color backgrounds.}}
