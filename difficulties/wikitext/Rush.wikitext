==What is [[File:Rush.png|50x50px]] <span style="color:cornflowerblue;text-shadow:0 2px 5px:cornflowerblue;font-family:Josefin Slab">Rush</span>?==
[[File:Rush.png|30px]] <span style="color:cornflowerblue;text-shadow:0 2px 5px:cornflowerblue;font-family:Josefin Slab">Rush</span> is a physically impossible difficulty that resides in class 9, before [[File:Hhhhhhhhhhhh.png|30px]] [[Aleph-VSC]], yet after [[File:Screenshot 2020-09-26 032504.jpg|35px]] [[The Crystal Core]]. It has certainly impossible jumps, obstacles the Roblox engine may not even be able to handle.

[[File:Rush.png|30px]] <span style="color:cornflowerblue;text-shadow:0 2px 5px:cornflowerblue;font-family:Josefin Slab">Rush</span> is a gimmicky difficulty, as it resides on time limits. Similarly, the page of this difficulty was made in 15 minutes, meaning that this isn't going to be one of the most high quality pages.

Due to this, the raw difficulty of this difficulty may be easier, but the constrained time limit certainly won't make it easy. Despite the time limit, it still won't be easy. You won't be able to beat the obstacles even without the time constraints. The time limits are designed in such a way that one would have to speedrun the obstacles in an almost optimal manner.

The Kol Metris rating of this difficulty is |~1920| and the tier rating of this difficulty would be around 20No.

==Icon Representation==
[[File:Rush.png|center|200x200px]]
<center> The icon depicts a dark blue with a few squares in the corners and various lines forming a border. In the center, there is text saying "RUSH" with light blue lines at the bottom. </center>

== Catches==

*Every obstacle of this difficulty is timed to be optimal
