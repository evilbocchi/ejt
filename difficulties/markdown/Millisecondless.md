Millisecondless is a Baseline Class 0 difficulty with a rating of -30, placed after Instant Win and before Win. It is humanly possible, meaning anyone could potentially beat it, but it is essentially unlosableâ€”the only way to fail is by disconnecting or encountering a bug. Towers of this difficulty are typically completed within milliseconds of entering, often by simply spawning on the winpad.
