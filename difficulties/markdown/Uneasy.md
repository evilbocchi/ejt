# Uneasy

Uneasy is a Class 3 sub-difficulty of Extreme. This difficulty is insanely hard to beat, and most obbyists may not even reach this difficulty. Even professional obbyists may struggle with towers of this difficulty, with it being even harder than Madness. There is the occasional trap, and obstacles here may consist of difficulty among the qualities of Tower of Confusion except slightly buffed. As a Class 3 difficulty, it has a real tower.

After beating Extreme, you face Uneasy difficulty. This difficulty has some obstacles which are going to make you feel uneasy to do the tower, despite the tower itself being mostly short and half empty, making it bearable to beat. Towers with this difficulty are hard to get consistent at due to their very confusing and difficult obstacles to memorize.

Trying to beat this difficulty can cause you to go uneasy on it even if you can do it simply.
