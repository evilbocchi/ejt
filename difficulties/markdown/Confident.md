# Confident

Confident is a Class 3 sub-difficulty that was originally created for the JCC wiki as Unfathomable, later ported to the JToHâ€™s Joke Towers Wiki as Confident. It was intended to be the borderline between human possibility and impossibility, though it no longer holds that position. The difficulty requires precise movements, strict timings, and a small amount of luck, with even minor mistakes leading to failure. Confident is placed after Eternalized and before Unreal, and is inspired by Nightmare. Preparation and practice are essential for tackling this challenge.
