==Introduction ~ [[File:16.png|50x50px]] <span style="color:skyblue;">'''16'''</span>==
[[File:16.png|30px]] <span style="color:skyblue;">'''16'''</span> is an unclassified difficulty, centered around the number 16. It was originally created in celebration of the user [[User:Viranenthusiast|Vira]]'s birthday, or September 10th. Originally created as a celebration of Vira's 14th birthday, it has since been repurposed each year to reflect Vira's passing birthdays, previously being known as 14 and 15.

Throughout this difficulty, it is frequent to find celebrations of Vira and other relevant material celebrating his birthday. Annually, this difficulty will update and thus be based around a new number. For September 10, 2025 to September 10, 2026, this difficulty is currently centered around the number 16, so thus the range of this difficulty is from Class 6 to Class 16 to reflect this.

As a result of this main gimmick, with each passing year this difficulty gets progressively harder, reflecting higher and higher classes which in turn, necessitate harder obstacles. It is for this reason that [[File:16.png|30px]] <span style="color:skyblue;">'''16'''</span> is an unclassified event difficulty, due to it being an annual occurrence.

As of current, this difficulty has surpassed [[File:TheHumanLimit.png|50x50px]] [[The Human Limit]], indicating that it is humanly impossible no matter its range.

==Explanation ~ [[File:16.png|50x50px]] <span style="color:skyblue;">'''16'''</span>==
When one first enters the difficulty, they will be presented with Class 6 obstacles, which progressively get harder. Many obstacles of this difficulty also relate to the number 16 in general, meaning that you would see 16 stud jumps and other associated obstacles throughout this difficulty.

On each of [[User:Viranenthusiast|Vira]]'s birthdays, this difficulty will buff itself and gain a new icon. In the case of the current state of the difficulty, it would then become the difficulty "17", thus surrounding itself around the number 17 and being between Class 7 and Class 17
