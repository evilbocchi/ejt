# Tap to Move

Tap to Move, or TTM for short, is a very easy difficulty. It revolves around one gimmick: Tap To Move, as the name implies. If you join a Roblox game and set the Movement Mode to "Tap To Move," you can simply tap anywhere to move there, unless there's a gap that's too far, a wall that's too high, or a slope that's too steep.

All obstacles in this difficulty revolve around this mechanic. Since all you have to do is tap on the screen to move to any place, it is fairly easy to use.
