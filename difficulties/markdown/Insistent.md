# Insistent

Insistent is a humanly impossible, Normal difficulty located in the middle of Class 6. It follows Absolutism and comes before Shocking. Any legitimate attempt at an Insistent obby is futile, as the obstacles are designed to be impossible to overcome without special tools or gear.

Obbies and towers of this difficulty are made for entertainment and are not meant to be completed legitimately. The icon features a mint-green phi symbol on a black-to-green gradient background, with a green outline and four-pointed stars in each corner. Insistent was created as a replacement for the deleted Exigent difficulty and is the first properly finished difficulty by YataDev in over two years.
