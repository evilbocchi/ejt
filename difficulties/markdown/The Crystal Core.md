# The Crystal Core

The Crystal Core is a class 8 difficulty, specifically a fabled difficulty. If built, it would be impossible and would have a massive frame, as it is a former legendary difficulty. It is considered harder than MegaDeath and anything before it. The difficulty is known for its extreme challenge, and millions would fail attempting to conquer it.

The official music for this difficulty is Crystallion - Crystal Clear. The icon is a transparent crystal surrounded by blue lights, with the brightest point at the bottom illuminating the picture.
