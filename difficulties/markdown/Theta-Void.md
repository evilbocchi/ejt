# Theta-Void

Theta-Void is a Class 6 difficulty and the penultimate difficulty of Mike's difficulty chart, preceding Ultimaniac. It is TAS impossible, meaning it cannot be beaten even with tool assistance. The name comes from the Greek letter theta (Î˜) and the word "Void," signifying its near-impossible nature.

Beating a difficulty of this magnitude would require immense skill and luck, and even greater challenges await in the difficulties that follow. Theta-Void stands as a symbol of the limits of possibility in the chart.
