# A

A is a Mid Class Negative difficulty, situated between True Ease and Felix the ДА. This difficulty is so easy that you don't even need to exist to beat it—you have already beaten it in every timeline. It is the absolute opposite of DEADLY TUBULAR DEATH, meaning you cannot lose in any possible way.

The only way to fail is by making the catches abide by your own rules, but otherwise, you can simply skip the difficulty or use teleporters to finish instantly. Building or scripting a floor for this difficulty is not possible, so it is often skipped or trivialized.
