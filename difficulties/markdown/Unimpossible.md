# Unimpossible

Unimpossible is the fourth difficulty of the entire Difficulty Chart, and is therefore a Class Negative difficulty. As its name suggests, this is the complete opposite of impossibility, and is transmaximally easy. You are always completing this difficulty, as with every beyond existence difficulty.

It's the complete antipode of Undefinable, it also succeeds Negativity, yet precedes Friendliness. It also contains two sub-difficulties: Almost Unimpossible and Unpossible, even though both of them are now CDC exclusive.
