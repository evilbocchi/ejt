# Remorseless

Remorseless is a difficulty in EToH represented by a magenta octagon. It is the hardest non-Soul Crushing difficulty and the last required for game progression. Obstacles in Remorseless towers are more challenging versions of those found in Challenging and Intense towers, often requiring hours of practice to master. The difficulty is known for its high punishment and is a rare but important milestone in the game's progression.
