<span style="background:linear-gradient(90deg,orange,white,orange); -webkit-background-clip:text !important; -webkit-text-fill-color:transparent;">'''Denial'''</span> is the final difficulty of the [[:Category:Liminality Chain|Liminality Chain]], with the other 2 in the chain being called [[File:Mysterious2.png|frameless|25x25px]] [[Mysterious]] and [[File:Undocumented.png|25x25px]] [[Undocumented]]. As the name suggests, you are denied from beating this difficulty. It’s that simple.

It also goes between [[File:Undocumented.png|25x25px|link=Undocumented]] [[Undocumented]] and [[File:AlphaNothing.png|25x25px]] [[Aleph-Something]] currently,  due to the fact that The Middleline was moved. <span style="background:linear-gradient(90deg,orange,white,orange); -webkit-background-clip:text !important; -webkit-text-fill-color:transparent;">'''Denial'''</span> also originated from '''The Difficulty Machine: Revamp''', all the way in Class 36. However, TDM:R has not gotten to class 36, albeit it was approved.

A tier rating for this would be at around 10,000, exponentially harder than the actual limit for tiers, and Kol Metris would be closer to |1500|.
==Icon Representation==
'''Denial'''’s icon is represented with an orange background and a dark orange border. There is a black pixel-like X with a smaller, white x in the direct middle. There is a dark orange outer X stretching to the borders, and two circle shaped lines on each of the inner spaces between the sides of the X.

== Trivia ==

* As said previously, if TDM:R had actually gotten to C36, this would be a Class Post-25/30 difficulty in TDM:R (around C36).
* This is the replacement for [[File:Soon.png|30px]] [[Hollow]] (which came back).

== Continuing on from this point ==
After completing <span style="background:linear-gradient(90deg,orange,white,orange); -webkit-background-clip:text !important; -webkit-text-fill-color:transparent;">'''Denial'''</span>, [[File:AlphaNothing.png|25x25px]] [[Aleph-Something]] is obviously posterior to this and therefore would be the next difficulty you would attempt.
