# Destructive

Destructive is a Class 5 difficulty that offers a break from wallwalks and killbricks, but is much harder than Malicious. It features mid-air corner clips and various glitches, requiring both skill and luck. Destructive is known for not following the standard Class 5 progression, being harder than its neighbors. It is the last difficulty before killbrick-spam becomes overwhelming, and marks a turning point toward even more challenging obstacles.
