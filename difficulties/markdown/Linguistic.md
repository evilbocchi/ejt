# Linguistic

Linguistic is an unclassified, intelligence-based difficulty defined by its overwhelming wall of text and complex logic. It is not skill-based, but rather tests the reader's ability to comprehend and process multifaceted phrases and ideas. The difficulty is theoretically impossible to beat, as it requires intelligence far beyond human capability.

Linguistic is not meant to be recreated in Roblox Studio, and its classification depends on the reader's intelligence. It exists as a unique, essay-like challenge that stands apart from traditional, skill-based difficulties.
