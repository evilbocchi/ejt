It is the second hardest difficulty of the ''True Hardest difficulties'' section of the Universal Difficulty Chart. 

{{Class7Difficulties|System Error}} <span style="font-weight;font-size:100%;background:-webkit-linear-gradient(red, maroon);-webkit-background-clip:text;-webkit-text-fill-color:transparent;">System Error</span> is beyond the assumed limit of difficulty; meaning it is uncertain if obstacles here are humanly or physically impossible. If Citadel of Void were humanly possible and were of Ultimate difficulty, for it to be System Error, the citadel would need to be buffed to the point where the human possibility of the gameplay itself is uncertain, and be extended further to inhumane lengths.

{{Class7Difficulties|System Error}} <span style="font-weight;font-size:100%;background:-webkit-linear-gradient(red, maroon);-webkit-background-clip:text;-webkit-text-fill-color:transparent;">[[System Error]]</span> has a similar color scheme to both <span style="font-weight;font-size:100%;background:-webkit-linear-gradient(red, maroon);-webkit-background-clip:text;-webkit-text-fill-color:transparent;">[[Monstrous]]</span> and <span style="font-weight;font-size:100%;background:-webkit-linear-gradient(red, maroon);-webkit-background-clip:text;-webkit-text-fill-color:transparent;">[[Ultimate]]</span>. 

The background has a black to red gradient, identical to the two previous difficulties, with less black as it fades into the crimson. The icon contains an unknown symbol colored in bright red, and holds the phrase ''<nowiki/>'System Error'.'' The words themselves have a gradient, the first letter of each word are a red tinted with white; the following letters gradually redden.

== Obstacles Section ==
As stated it is uncertain if currently named System Error obstacles are humanly impossible or physically impossible, but System Error ''is'' meant to be humanly impossible.

You're probably sick of seeing the same color schemes and playing these maximally-edgy towers. However you will not find that; for the next difficulty you'll face is the great [[Supreme]], though if that is far too much for you, then simply just head onto [[Simply Beyond]].
