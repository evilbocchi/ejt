==What is '''<span style="color:#2877e7;text">Win</span>'''? ==
'''<span style="color:#2877e7;text">Win</span>''' is the second difficulty (third if you count sub-difficulties) in Class 0. The only thing you can do here is win this difficulty, as the only obstacles are extremely short waiting periods. There is no way to lose. Well, there is, but most of the ways you could do so are highly improbable.

According to the obstacles of [[Astronomical]], this is the first difficulty with a full rating to buildable. [[Millisecondless]] has waiting periods too brief to be consistently replicated within Studio, and so it is unbuildable. This means that you end up with a lot of inaccurate [[Instant Win]] structures, as many of them are using winpads. Winpads have teleportation delays upwards of 500 milliseconds, which means that they are "too hard" to be classified as IW. Combine this with short falls (1-3 studs), and you end up with towers like ToQG technically being Astronomical or even Win.

In short, Win is the first difficulty you'll most likely actually play if you're going through the chart. You won't be here for long, however, as the difficulty is seconds long and basically unfailable.

==Ways to Lose:==
There are presumably about 65 ways you can possibly lose this difficulty in any way. Here are some of the more common and possible ways you can lose this difficulty:
#Device restart/shutdown
#Leaving/disconnecting from the game
#Server shutdown
#Bluescreen/kernel panic
#Hardware damage causing disconnection from the game
#Game malfunction
#Other ways that may most likely trigger something that's already listed above.

==Icon Representation==
<span style="color:#2877e7;text">'''Win'''</span>'s icon is basically the same as [[Instant Win|<span style="color:#002eff;text">Instant Win</span>]], but instead the color is a paler blue, and, the "-_-" face is smaller and thinner, and the color of the face is bright blue instead of pure white. The old icon represents DEATH and Aleph Null's icons mixed together, which is highly unfitting for how easy the difficulty is. Said old icon is also used in the difficulty [[Aleph-DEATH]].

==Trivia==

* The original icon was an Aleph-Null symbol with the DEATH icon on it. The icon was eventually changed to something more.. ''[[pleasant]]'' for this difficulty.
**It was likely ancient edits from the early days, or a real icon! The archives are unknown.
**This icon is currently used for [[Aleph-DEATH]], a High-Class 8 difficulty.
* Although the original difficulty was made by Veblicon, it is still in the hands of Eisenhover. 
**This is because the original page was on JET (which was eventually deleted), and not JJT.
*Win used to have 25 obstacle ranges within it's spectrum, (used to have 20 which for the time was the most ever in this wiki).
**Most of the obstacle ranges were removed due to them reducing the quality of the page.

==Continuing from this point ==
Wow, you won! No surprise. Are you bored? Please… Just move on to {{Class1Difficulties|Effortless}} [[w:c:jtoh:Effortless|<span style="color:#00ce02;text">Effortless</span>]]. Or, if you ''really'' want to play a Difficulty Waiting Simulator, then move onto [[File:SquareDoNothing.png|frameless|30x30px]] [[Do Nothing|<span style="color:#99d0e7;text">Do Nothing</span>]] or you could've gone to [[File:Winful.png|frameless|31x31px]] <span style="color: #4169e1;">''Winful''</span> before it was deleted.

Just please, move on into the JToH range. Stop wasting your time.{{DifficultiesNavbox}}
