# Absolutism

Absolutism is a Mid Class 6 difficulty, harder than D-I-E but easier than Insistent. At this point, continuing further is highly discouraged, as the challenges become nearly impossible. The skill and luck required are immense, and even luck manipulators would struggle. Practicing extensively is recommended for anyone attempting this difficulty.
