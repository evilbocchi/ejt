# Harming

Harming is a Mid Class 2 revived sub-difficulty of Menacing. It comes before EToH's Challenging difficulty and serves as a gateway to tougher challenges. Harming incorporates techniques from Menacing and other similar difficulties, and is known for being a significant roadblock for many players. The difficulty is designed to test a player's dedication and can be mentally taxing.

Harming has been revived multiple times and once had a version called Hyper-Harming in Class 7, which no longer exists. The difficulty is represented by a simple red background with a sad emoticon, symbolizing its challenging and sometimes frustrating nature.
