== What is {{RainbowText|Omega}}?==
{{RainbowText|Omega}} (sometimes stylized as OMEGA) is a difficulty a lot harder than {{Unimaginable}}, but is easier than [[Aleph-Null|<span style="color:#808080; text-shadow:0 0 3px #000">'''Aleph-Null'''</span>]]. Omega is represented by a rainbow color scheme. All obstacles in this difficulty are extremely obscure, as with any difficulty above [[TARTARUS|<span style="color:#c2dff1">'''TARTARUS'''</span>]]. This is also considered by the JHT community to be the first "JHT SC" in the chart, that role taking up the Omega+ difficulties.

Towers in this difficulty need to take around months to make, as itâ€™s hard to not only calculate individual jumps extensively, but to even think of new ones. Verifying a tower here though is on a whole new level, taking many months to even years. Some also consider this the first physically impossible difficulty, although this attribution is debated in the community, mostly alongside [[Malicious]] and Supreme (or what comes after them, specifically), This is the difficulty of TUM.

==Trivia==  

*This difficulty's name was based off of the frame and text at the beginning of Floor 22 of Citadel of Void.
*This difficulty used to have 6 fanmade, unofficial sub difficulties. They were nearly identical, with the exception that they had a different Greek letter on it, and were meant to fill the difficulty gap between {{RainbowText|Omega}} and [[Immeasurable|<span style="color:#5c2525; text-shadow:0 0 4px #000">'''Immeasurable'''</span>]] before [[Aleph-Null|<span style="color:#808080; text-shadow:0 0 3px #000">'''Aleph-Null'''</span>]] was introduced.
**These difficulties were named Omega-Alpha, Omega-Beta, Omega-Gamma, Omega-Delta, Omega-Epsilon, and Omega-Zeta.
*The name of this difficulty was improperly changed from {{RainbowText|Omega}} to Mythical on December 18th, 2021, then changed back on March 24, 2022.
*{{RainbowText|Omega}} was originally rejected by the community, but soon became an iconic difficulty in the wiki.
