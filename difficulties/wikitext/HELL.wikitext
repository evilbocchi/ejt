==What is '''<span style="color:#7ab6e9">HELL</span>'''?==
'''<span style="color:#7ab6e9">HELL</span>''' is a difficulty that is represented by the color light blue, but with text "<code>XD</code>" on it. It is assigned to towers that are harder than '''[[DEATH]]''' difficulty and easier than '''[[TARTARUS|<span style="color:#c2dff1">'''TARTARUS'''</span>]]''' difficulty. 

This is a ''humanly impossible'' difficulty, meaning it is probably impossible for even the most elite of obbyists to do a tower of this magnitude. Most towers in '''<span style="color:#7ab6e9">HELL</span>''' difficulty will utilize jumps that will demotivate/hindrance the player in one way or another. 

To use macros to beat towers in this difficulty, each obstacle must be tested individually with excessive logical and physical calculations. Even beating this with boost items will be absurdly difficult.

==Towers with '''<span style="color:#7ab6e9">HELL</span>''' Difficulty==

*ToTRD - [[Tower of The Roof's Demise]] (Low HELL)
*ToMS - [[Tower of Monochromatic Symmetry]] (Low-Mid HELL)
*ToBH - [[Tower of Bullet Hell]] (Mid HELL)
*ToBDB - [[Tower of Blindingly Dark Bliss]] (Mid HELL)
*ToCYaN - [[Tower of Corruption, Yelling and Nonsense]] (Peak HELL)

==Trivia==

*Towers here are around the same difficulty as tier 25.
*This is the third difficulty in a series which some JHT members call the "Heart-Wrenching Difficulties".
*This is one of the 3 JHT difficulties that have an "<code>XD</code>" used for their icon, the other 2 being '''[[WHY|<span style="color:#000">'''WHY'''</span>]]''' and '''[[TARTARUS|<span style="color:#c2dff1">'''TARTARUS'''</span>]]'''.
*This difficulty was made by [https://www.roblox.com/users/1710070/profile Bob_9001].

==Continuing from this point==
Good job, you somehow managed to pass a humanly impossible difficulty. To move on, you can try '''[[TARTARUS|<span style="color:#c2dff1">'''TARTARUS'''</span>]]''' next.
