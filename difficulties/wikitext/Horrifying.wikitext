==What is Horrifying?==
'''Horrifying''' is a Mid [[:Category:Class 3|Class 3]] [[:Category:Soul Crushing|Soul Crushing]] [[:Category:Sub-Difficulties|Sub-Dificulty]] of [[File:TerrifyingDifficulty.jpg|25px]] [[w:c:jtoh:Terrifying|Terrifying]]. You should try to do these towers after completing a [[File:TerrifyingDifficulty.jpg|25px]] [[w:c:jtoh:Terrifying|Terrifying]] tower. Just note that this is insanely hard.

Also, this difficulty is nearly humanly impossible because it is in [[:Category:Class 3|class 3]]. One of the [[w:c:jtoh:Hints|warnings]] for a tower of this difficulty is, "NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE" and, "NOPE, YOU ARE NOT BEATING THIS ON MOBILE" due to how hard it is. Good luck.

===Icon representation===
*'''New:''' The icon is a cyan square, which is 75% white.
*'''Old:''' The icon is a <span style="color:#00BFFF;">light blue</span> triangle on a <span style="color:#FFFFFF;">white</span> background.
The decal doesn't exist yet for either version.

==Towers of this difficulty==
*[[w:c:jtoh:Tower of Impossible Movement|Tower of Impossible Movement]] (JToH)
*[[w:c:jtoh:ToAR|Tower of Alien Radiance]] (JToH)

*[https://www.roblox.com/games/10406214285/Quasis-Towers-of-Nonsense Why Isn't This a Tower?] (QToN)

==Trivia==
*This is the easiest [[:Category:Sub-Difficulties|sub-difficulty]] in [[Obelisk of Endless Difficulty Amplifying]] that is [[:Category:Soul Crushing|soul crushing]] or above, the hardest being [[User blog:EpicTheGamer2014/Malicious-Zeta|<span style="color:#696969;">Malicious-Zeta</span>]].
*Some people might get this confused with [[w:c:jtohs-hardest-towers:Horrific|Horrific]].
*Horrifying's icon was revamped for looking bad.

==Continuing from this point==
If you want to continue doing [[:Category:Sub-Difficulties|sub-difficulties]], the next [[:Category:Sub-Difficulties|sub-difficulty]] of [[w:c:jtoh:Terrifying|Terrifying]] is ''Intellectual'', which was deleted, or if you just want to the next difficulty, continue on to [[w:c:Jtoh:Catastrophic|Catastrophic]].
