The difficulty of this ranges from about [[File:TFirDNew.png|30px]][[The First Difficulty]] to [[File:Babass.png|30px]][[Babass dficuklty]], meaning it is the unclassified difficulty with the greatest range, due to the other unclassifieds going from [[The First Difficulty]] to [[The Final Difficulty.|The Final Difficulty]] at maximum.

==Icon Representation==
'''Sketchy'''’s icon is represented by a paper background with a light grey background, and many different sketches. There is an angry head, a black scribble, a happy emoticon, a hand drawn XD, the symbol gar, another scribble, a sad emoticon with a tear, two other gar symbols rotated 90 degrees respectively, a agitated emoticon with sweat, a DX symbol, a triangle, a circle, a frowning emoticon, another agitated emoticon, a T_T emoticon and  an agitated person.

== Obstacles/Premise ==
'''<span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:100%;background:-webkit-linear-gradient(270deg, white, grey, black);-webkit-background-clip:text;-webkit-text-fill-color:transparent;">Sketchy</span>''' is an odd difficulty, which is why it cannot be classified. In this difficulty, you posess a sketchbook that has the power to make almost anything come to life.  You can give yourself teleportation tools, noclip, coils; in fact, you can do everything (except for automatically losing any [[:Category:Beyond Existence Difficulties|beyond existence difficulties]] and winning any [[:Category:Beyond Logic Difficulties|beyond logic difficulties]]). Due to this, the difficulty is what you want it to be; it can be instantaneous or painfully hard.

Also, any loopholes found via the sketchbook you now possess will immediately be negated, and this rule cannot be negated.
==Towers in this difficulty==
Naturally, due to the premise of this difficulty, non-fictional towers cannot be made in this difficulty. However, fictional towers can still be listed.
* '''<span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:100%;background:-webkit-linear-gradient(270deg, white, grey, black);-webkit-background-clip:text;-webkit-text-fill-color:transparent;">Tower of Conceptual Convenience (ToCC)</span>'''
*'''<span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:100%;background:-webkit-linear-gradient(270deg, white, grey, black);-webkit-background-clip:text;-webkit-text-fill-color:transparent;">Steeple of Your Own Imagination (SoYOI)</span>'''
*'''<span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:100%;background:-webkit-linear-gradient(270deg, white, grey, black);-webkit-background-clip:text;-webkit-text-fill-color:transparent;">Futuron of Sketchbook Troubles (FoST)</span>'''
==Trivia==
*This difficulty was inspired by [[The Sketchbook World]].
*This was intended to be a [[TDE’s FTE Custom Difficulty Chart/Main Chart|TDE’s FTE Custom Difficulty Chart]] Unclassified Difficulty, but became an [[Alternate Difficulty Chart|alternate chart]] unclassified.
==Continuing from this point==
It’s your take. You could move onto literally any difficulty. It does not matter. What’s even the point of this section for unclassified? They don’t have a proper placement for a reason.
