==What is [[File:UDEADSONicon.png|frameless|32x32px]] '''U DED SON'''?==
{{NewDifficultyInfobox|title1=U DED SON|image1=UDEADSONicon.png|caption1=U DED SON!|class=[[:Category:Class 6|Class 6]]|rating=48|type=Pseudo-Difficulty|previous={{Class7Difficulties|Fatal Error}} [[Fatal Error]]|next=[[File:Funny-windows-error22.jpg|30px]] [[REEE... !!!]]|date_added=29/12/2019|creator(s)=Unknown|alt_previous=|alt_next=|difficulty_range=Low to High|decal_id=[https://www.roblox.com/library/18579950513/yikes Here]|class_range=Bottom|chain(s)=RoPD}}
[[File:UDEADSONicon.png|frameless|30x30px]] '''U DED SON''' is a Class 6 Difficulty that lies before [[File:Funny-windows-error22.jpg|30px]] [[REEE... !!!|REEE...!!!]] and after {{Class7Difficulties|Fatal Error}} [[Fatal Error|<span style="color:white;text-shadow:0 2px 5px red">'''Fatal Error'''</span>]]. The main colors for this difficulty are going to be pink, purple, and peach. Acting as the last barrier before the Low spectrum of Class 6, you probably shouldn’t attempt it, considering it’s even beyond TAS and human capabilities.

Of course, this is impossible, as you'd have to do unimaginable glitches and use confusing and infeasible strategies to beat this. You'd also have to practice for months and even years if you're a lower tier obbyist.

==Icon Representation==
[[File:UDEADSONicon.png|frameless|30x30px]] <b>U DED SON</b><nowiki/>'s icon represents a grey jeep in the background, and a dog being hit by a frisbee on the front. And no, it's not fatal.  The icon for this has been confirmed for a while now, and was first seen in the [[Citadel of Impossible Victory]].
