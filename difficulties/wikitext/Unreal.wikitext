__TOC__

== What is <span style="color:#4B00C8">'''Unreal'''</span>? ==
<span style="color:#4B00C8">'''Unreal'''</span> is a difficulty represented by dark purple with a black square. It is above '''[[Horrific|<span style="color:#9691ff">Horrific</span>]]''' and below '''[[nil|<span style="color:#5e5e62">nil</span>]]''' on the difficulty chart. Towers in this difficulty demand absurd skill, to the point of almost being considered luck. This difficulty is barely humanly possible, since you need an ungodly amount of skill and strategy up your sleeve to comfortably do it. The accuracy of towers in this difficulty is quite low as there are not many towers people can compare difficulties with, meaning some <span style="color:#4B00C8">'''Unreal'''</span> towers may be very overâ€“ or underrated. Above Mid Unreal (around STH difficulty) is generally considered to be humanly impossible on only 60 fps, so towers of a higher difficulty must be completed with FPS switching.
== In Eternal Towers of Hell ==
<span style="color:#4B00C8">'''Unreal'''</span> used to be a split difficulty from '''[[Catastrophic|<span style="color:white">Catastrophic</span>]]''' between '''[[nil|<span style="color:#5e5e62">nil</span>]]''' and the latter, and was once official in '''EToH'''. However, the difficulty was removed for being redundant according to Jukecallaa. In 2022, it had been re-added in the non-canon Pit of Misery subrealm however that also got removed from EToH and now only exists in The Eternal Abyss, Pit of Misery's official sequal owned by bLockerman666.

== On Completion ==
You are unbelievable. Greatest job ever if you have beaten a tower of this difficulty because currently only like ten people have beaten a tower of this difficulty as of early November 2024. Can I even be sure if you are human? You are impossibly talented and lucky. You must be the best obbyist out there.

== Towers ==
A tower's name in bold means it has been beaten.
A double asterisk (**) on the verifier's name means there's no recording.

==Trivia== 

*In '''EToH''', '''[[Catastrophic|<span style="color:white">Catastrophic</span>]]''' used to be named '''Unreal'''.
*[[Citadel of Infinite Void]] was the first full-length tower of this difficulty to be beaten by a human. It was supposedly beaten by SerenityDiesAlone with the lack of raw footage, and later by skitsuna, with recorded proof of legitimacy<ref name=":0" />.
*This difficulty used to be represented with only a dark purple color. This changed when the difficulty was semi-officially re-added to JToH, being changed to reflect the design still in use today.
