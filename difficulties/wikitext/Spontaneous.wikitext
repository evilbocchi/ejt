</h2>
'''What is''' [[File:Spontaneous.png|30x30px]] <span style="color:#81ff73;text-shadow:0 2px 5px #81ff73;font-family:Josefin Slab">'''<big>Spontaneous</big>'''</span>? 

Well, [[File:Spontaneous.png|30x30px]] <span style="color:#81ff73;text-shadow:0 2px 5px #81ff73;font-family:Josefin Slab">'''<big>Spontaneous</big>'''</span> is an incredibly simple class 0 difficulty and a successor of [[File:AutomaticNew.png|30px]] [[Automatic]] and a predecessor of [[File:JoyfulDiffIcon.png|30px]] [[Joyful]], the first difficulty requiring input. This difficulty does not require any input but is possible to fail if one was to try to do so deliberately. This means you can go AFK and still win, since you don't have to do anything! Due to this, it is one of the easiest difficulties one may encounter in the chart. 

This difficulty is humanly possible, meaning that it is possible for humans to complete. In fact, it is so easy that almost every human could beat this difficulty. In fact, it is possible for some smarter organisms to even complete. 

[[File:Spontaneous.png|30x30px]] <span style="color:#81ff73;text-shadow:0 2px 5px #81ff73;font-family:Josefin Slab">'''<big>Spontaneous</big>'''</span> relies heavily on client objects such as conveyors and elevators. An average tower in this difficulty would have various contraptions to get the player to the winpad without the player performing a single action. 

Its name originates from the word spontaneous, which means both natural and uninhibited and instinctive and involuntary. This means that this difficulty is also very simple and natural, and retains the automatic nature of [[File:AutomaticNew.png|30px]] [[Automatic]]. 

[[File:Spontaneous.png|30x30px]] <span style="color:#81ff73;text-shadow:0 2px 5px #81ff73;font-family:Josefin Slab">'''<big>Spontaneous</big>'''</span> is also the border of automated possibility, meaning that this is the last difficulty you do not need to perform any input in. In difficulties after this, you would need to perform at least one action. 

The difficulty would have a tier 0 and would have a [[Metris|Kol Metris]] rating of |1.2| due to its placement. 

Enough with the introduction, let's move onto the Icon Representation!

*This difficulty uses its own custom-colored headers; however, they aren't a template.
*This is the first difficulty to have both a Belowground and a Peripheral section on the Obstacle table. 
**This used [[File:Cataclysmicreal.jpg|30x30px]] [[Cataclysmic]]'s table that had a Peripheral section, but not a Belowground section.
*This difficulty was created after class 0 was changed to high standard after many class 0 difficulties were deleted.
*[[File:Spontaneous.png|30x30px]] <span style="color:#81ff73;text-shadow:0 2px 5px #81ff73;font-family:Josefin Slab">'''<big>Spontaneous</big>'''</span> was originally planned to be before [[File:AutomaticNew.png|30px]] [[Automatic]], but this was changed (obviously)
*This difficulty was then moved to the finale of Class -1.
*Its icon was originally going to feature a ":)" emoticon, before it was changed to resemble [[File:AutomaticNew.png|30px]] [[Automatic]]'s "=D" emoticon.
*The icon description of this difficulty was made by [[User:YataDev|YataDev]]?.
