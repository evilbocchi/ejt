# Doog

You've encountered this Dog... You don't know what to do. That thing has the face of a demon. If you are going to pass through, you must deal with its face or else you won't be able to defeat him.

Doog is yet another one of the classic difficulties, but stands out as one of the scary icons on the team. The difficulty is placed between Infinity and Dissension. Facing this creature is scary due to its face—it's terrifying. Some people wouldn't consider it as scary, but some would. People have been traumatized from this picture, but let's continue with this difficulty.

Obstacles in this difficulty are described as "Godly Movements"—they are beyond physically impossible, similar to SUFFER jumps but on another stage of agonizingness. You must be aware of your movements or else you will suffer and fail the whole chart. This is your only chance of passing through this difficulty with this warning. Good luck.
