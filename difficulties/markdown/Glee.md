# Glee

Glee is a High Class 1 sub-difficulty, positioned after Lovely and before Flowerness. It once had a sub-difficulty called Stone in the excavation chain. Glee was previously located in Mid Class 0 as a successor to Tranquil and a predecessor to Heavenlike, but was later transferred to JJT.

This difficulty is extremely easy, featuring very basic obstacles that most players can complete without much effort. Glee is designed to be accessible to nearly everyone, making it a good starting point for new players. The obstacles are simple and forgiving, and players are encouraged to move on to harder difficulties like Effortlessless or Effortless after completing Glee.
