==What is '''''<big>[[Godlike]]?</big>''''' ==
===Introduction===
You have conquered [[Errorisation]], and you feel proud of yourself. But then you realize that you have fallen into a trap by beating it. You find yourself in a prismatic hell, and you remember Omega from five classes ago. Until you realize... 

The last time you faced Omega and won was definitely not the last time you'd see it...

=== Explanation ===
Godlike is a difficulty, rated 86.5. It is in High Class 8 and is a physically impossible difficulty, located in between [[Errorisation]] and [[Esoteric]]. This is basically buffed [[w:c:Jtohs-hardest-towers:Omega|Omega]].

Even trying to do a single jump here is immeasurably hard, and doing as much as building an accurate tower of this difficulty is a huge achievement. There is literally no point in doing towers this difficult, as they are physically impossible. These obstacles are mainly made to hindrance/demotivate the player to go further, not stop them entirely. 

Once again, there isn’t any point in trying to do this difficulty, because in all seriousness, this difficulty should stop you from continuing to [[Virtual|Esoteric]]. However, if you really want to waste your life on beating a difficulty at this magnitude of difficulty, I wish you good luck.

==Icon Representation==
The icon is a bunch of somewhat transparent, oval-like shapes forming a vague circle, in the center, it becomes more and more white until it's fully white. All of this is on top of a black background.
==Catches==
[[Godlike|well let's just say uh there are lots of unfair catches]]    
*Being frame-locked into 45 fps.
*Any kind of TAS detected will be removed from the game, and slightly buffing one random obstacle
*Using exploits will automatically IP ban you from Roblox.
*Using noclip will have the noclip tool deleted from the game.
*Using heal in any spot where it would be unreasonable or impossible to heal in will have the heal tool deleted from the game.
*If your PC has robloxfpsunlocker, the game will install a virus that will delete the software from your PC.
*You are not allowed to do ANYTHING to yourself, such as: 
**Increasing your walkspeed. [[Godlike|(btw decreasing any ws or jp to 0 makes the winpad be able to send you to]] [[BobuxDeath|this difficulty]][[Godlike|)]]
**Increasing your jumppower.
**Making yourself immortal.
**Giving yourself more then 100 max hp.
**Setting your x, y, and z axis to where the winpad is.
**And so much more.
***If you do anything of the aforementioned, you will get banned from the game permanently.
*Failing here will send you back to [[QR Code]], however [[Esoteric]] will be locked with a 256 character password that randomizes every 2.5 minutes.

none yet either.
==Trivia: ==  
* This difficulty was originally gonna be called Mythical, due to '''''<u>[[w:c:jtohs-hardest-towers:Omega|Omega]]</u>''''' being renamed back to well... Omega.   
**However, there was already a page for something called Mythical, so this difficulty was renamed to '''''Godlike.'''''
*This is [[User:User321865|User321865's]] first difficulty, so it kinda sucks.
*However, this is now owned by [[User:Feoducky|Feoducky]].
*This was going have different obstacles like some IRL obstacles, however it was scrapped just because it would take too long and she'd rather use it in a different difficulty. However they're still there, albeit as a blog post.
==Continuing on from this point ==
Honestly, quite incredible. You have doubted all of my expectations, and as such, I accept defeat. I recommend to take a break after this, however, if you are still hungry for more difficulties, then I guess you can try [[Esoteric]].{{DifficultiesNavbox}}
