It is the fourth hardest difficulty of the Universal Difficulty Chart. 

[[File:Bettermonstrous.png|frameless|30x30px]] <span style="color:#800000;">'''Monstrous'''</span> simply represents difficulty beyond the limit of Malicious, anything labeled as "Beyond Malicious" would generally fall under Monstrous. If Chaotic Tower were to be the limit of Malicious, then this would be seen as any tower that is an extension or relatively normal buff of Chaotic Tower.

<div class="mw-collapsible-content">
[[File:Bettermonstrous.png|frameless|30x30px]] <span style="color:#800000;">'''Monstrous'''</span>'s icon is quite simple. First, it has one of the Greek letters in the center of the icon, highlighted in red and said letter is named Zeta or  'ζ'. The background is a simple gradient, black fading into red. It's really just a normal icon with a symbol on it. Ol' jazz.

==Obstacles Section ==
Notice: The obstacles below are highly, and inaccurately estimated, so take them with a grain of salt. They may either be not Monstrous, physically impossible or in some cases, easier than Monstrous.

==Continuing from this point==
Wow--yer really a monster. Travelling through floors like this without going insane, I'll give you it: you're good. However you're ''far'' from anywhere to be considered an ultimate being, there is still far more to go, so get done with it. Good luck on [[Ultimate]], or [[Inimical]] if you wish to start with a sub-difficulty.
