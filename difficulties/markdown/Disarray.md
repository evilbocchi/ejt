# Disarray

Disarray is a Class 4, humanly impossible difficulty that serves as a border between theoretical physical possibility and truly impossible gameplay. It is harder than Omega and easier than SUFFER. The path through Disarray is confusing and relentless, trapping players in an ascending pentagon tower where a single wrong move leads to repeated failure. The obstacles are indecipherable and nearly impossible, making progress a tremendous challenge. Reaching this difficulty is a testament to a player's dedication, but moving forward is even more daunting.
