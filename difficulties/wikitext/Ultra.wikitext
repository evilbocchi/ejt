== What is Ultra? ==
[[File:Inferior difficulty.PNG|frameless|30x30px]] '''Ultra''' is a Peak class 5 sub-difficulty that follows  [[File:Simply Beyond.jpg|frameless|30x30px]] [[Simply Beyond]] as a sub-difficulty, and is the last challenge (optional). This is the end of your victory. Prepare to feel defeated as this difficulty is Humanly Impossible.
== Icon representation ==
Ultra's icon consists of the basic class 7 default icon, with  [[File:MonstrousNew.jpg|30px]] [[Monstrous]], [[File:UltimateNew.jpg|30px]] [[Ultimate]], [[File:Undoable.PNG|frameless|30x30px]] <span style="background:linear-gradient(90deg,red,maroon,black); -webkit-background-clip:text !important; -webkit-text-fill-color:transparent;">Undoable</span> (Deleted)  [[File:Simply Beyond.jpg|frameless|30x30px]] [[Simply Beyond]], and [[File:Nano Collection.png|frameless|30x30px]] <span style="background:linear-gradient(90deg,red,maroon,black); -webkit-background-clip:text !important; -webkit-text-fill-color:transparent;">Nano Collection</span> (Deleted) 's icons all present here along with a carat for good measures.. Except you won't feel good coming out of this sub-difficulty, that is if you even will.

== Continuing from this point ==
Good game. It's best to now try {{Class8Difficulties|Supreme|50px}} [[Supreme]], but I can see, and I know you don't have enough skill to do so. We need to go to [[File:Critical.png|30px]] [[Critical]]. Good luck there!
