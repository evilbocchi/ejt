If one is to complete a tower of [[File:Mystical.jpeg|frameless|30x30px]] <span class="mystical">Mystical</span> difficulty, it is recommended that they beat a few more towers of this difficulty before trying to complete a tower of {{Class5Difficulties|Immeasurable}} [[w:c:jtohs-hardest-towers:Immeasurable|Immeasurable]] difficulty. Alternatively, they could try a tower of [[File:Shimeshimeyehshimeyehshimeyaah.jpg|frameless|30x30px]] [[Reality]] difficulty, as it is a sub difficulty of this difficulty. However, this is not recommended, as going through this route will most likely lengthen the progression of one’s journey in the obbying community.
