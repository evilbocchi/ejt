# Classical

Classical is a Class 3 sub-difficulty, one of the first difficulties of low class 2. It is harder than Madness and easier than Extreme. Classical is very hard and will take many attempts to complete, serving as a near human-impossible challenge. The icon is a blue background with the word "die" in text, reflecting its old-school, tough nature.
