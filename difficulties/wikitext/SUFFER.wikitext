==What is [[File:SUFFER.png|25px]] <span id="suffer">SUFFER</span>?==
[[File:SUFFER.png|25px]] <span id="suffer">SUFFER</span> is a Class 4 Difficulty which succeeds {{Class5Difficulties|Omega}} [[w:c:jtohs-hardest-towers:Omega|<span>'''Omega''']], but precceeds [[File:AlephnullDifficulty.webp|30px]] [[Aleph-Null]] or {{Class5Difficulties|CHAOS}} '''[[CHAOS]]'''.

Suffer is notorious for tormenting glitches. As an example, a book glitch wrap or a very fast falling platform on top with an instakill at the bottom. Making significantly tougher and generally more impossible than {{Class5Difficulties|Omega}} [[w:c:jtohs-hardest-towers:Omega|<span>'''Omega''']], but however, remaining easier than  [[File:AlephnullDifficulty.webp|30px]] [[Aleph-Null]] or {{Class5Difficulties|CHAOS}} '''[[CHAOS]]'''.
