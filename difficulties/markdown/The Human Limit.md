# The Human Limit

The Human Limit (THL), originally known as Zilch, is an official sub-difficulty in Class 3, located between Anguish and nil. It represents the absolute peak of human capability in terms of skill. Anything beyond this is considered humanly impossible. Obstacles of this difficulty require extreme precision, accuracy, timing, and positioning, testing the limits of human ability.

No player has ever completed a tower of this difficulty, as it demands near-inhuman skill and reaction time. The Human Limit focuses on the hardest jumps a human can do consistently using skill, without relying on luck.
