# Purgatory

Purgatory is a Low Class 4 Humanly Impossible Difficulty, originating from HelloArtâ€™s Extended Difficulty Chart. It represents the zone between Heaven and Hell, requiring absurd effort beyond the capabilities of any obbyist. Even with tools like TAS, only singular jumps might be possible, but completing the entire difficulty is not. Purgatory is a major milestone for those venturing into the most punishing challenges.
